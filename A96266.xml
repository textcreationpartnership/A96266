         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Have determined to collect and put together ſome of the more <hi>Notable Sayings</hi> of the Holy Scripture, which make for the better <hi>underſtanding</hi> of this Book, that whoſoever ſhall pleaſe to conſider them, or ſuch like, he may be able thereby more <hi>eaſily,</hi> and without <hi>ſcruple</hi> to turn over this ſmall Treatiſe;
<pb facs="tcp:137210:3"/>eſpecially if he come to thoſe places, by which the moſt <hi>illuminated Matthew Wyer</hi> complained of his <hi>Inward Pains</hi> and anguiſh (which throughout the Book he frequently did) leſt the Reader there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be frighted from them, or ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſuch <hi>Pangs</hi> and <hi>Deſertions</hi> for <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>fantaſtical.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, by means of theſe, he will remember and conſider, that this way of the <hi>Croſs</hi> (although now adaies it be almoſt utterly unknown and forſaken) was e'n to Chriſt, and all his true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers alwaies <hi>accuſtomed</hi> and <hi>trod in.</hi> For this is that <hi>narrow way and that ſtraight gate,</hi> by which we muſt enter into life: yea by this ſame way, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>ſorrows, ſufferings, ſtreights,</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> our <hi>Fore-runner</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, thorough the whole courſe of his life, <hi>walked</hi> even to his <hi>ſepulcher;</hi> and hath made it plain to and for us all, whom he would have to be <hi>Imitators</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:137210:3"/>of himſelf, for it behooved him to ſuffer, and ſo to enter into his glory. Of him <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>He had no form nor comelineſs, and we ſaw him, and he was not of an aſpect, ſo as that we could be delighted in him; a man deſpiſed, and the leaſt of men, a man of ſorrows and knowing infirmity,</hi> &amp;c. Obſerve and conſider, O thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Reader! together with all thoſe who truly love Jeſus Chriſt, and deſire to be <hi>Imitators</hi> of him, how narrow, and ſharp, and how many <hi>Pangs,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions</hi> is this way filled with, which yet Chriſt <hi>entred into,</hi> after his <hi>laſt ſupper,</hi> and has left to us for an <hi>enſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> For then it was, that his Soul was <hi>ſorrowful</hi> even to the <hi>death,</hi> then it was, that for very agony <hi>he ſweat drops of blood, and prayed to his heavenly Father thrice, that if it were poſſible, that cup might paſs from him;</hi> nor yet was he heard, nor w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb facs="tcp:137210:4"/>any helper preſent with him. The <hi>wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi> was to be trodden, and the <hi>cup to be drunk down;</hi> the <hi>flood</hi> was to be <hi>waded</hi> thorough, and <hi>obedience</hi> to be <hi>yielded</hi> unto the <hi>Father,</hi> even to the very <hi>death of the croſs:</hi> upon that he was <hi>hanged naked, between two Thieeves,</hi> as the incendary &amp; trumpeter of the ſeditious: preſently after they <hi>divided his Garments by lot</hi> even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes; many alſo <hi>ſhaking their heads at him,</hi> ſo that nothing elſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed him round, but <hi>Ignominy;</hi> and <hi>Reproach,</hi> and one <hi>ſorrow</hi> trod upon the <hi>heels</hi> of another. Then the <hi>Waves</hi> of <hi>afflictons</hi> were ſo many that they entred even into his ſoul (becauſe he was deſerted of his Father) that out of meer <hi>preſſures</hi> and <hi>dereliction,</hi> he cried out with a loud voice; <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me!</hi> All which are found deſcribed at large in the Evangeliſts, Prophets and
<pb facs="tcp:137210:4"/>in the Pſalms, eſpecially in the <hi>22</hi> Pſalm, where the Prophet complains in the perſon of Chriſt: <hi>My God I called unto thee all the day, but thou wouldſt not hear, I a am worm and no man.</hi> Alſo in <hi>Pſalm 60. Save me O God, becauſe the floods have entred into my Soul, I am ſtuck faſt in the deep mire, and there is no bottom;</hi> and ſo on, to the end of the <hi>Pſalm.</hi> Moreover in <hi>Pſalm. 88. My ſoul is filled with evil, and my life approacheth unto the grave, or Hell,</hi> &amp;c. By which and the like ſayings, expreſſing the torments of Chriſt, the whole <hi>Pſalter</hi> with the Prophets are perfectly filled.</p>
                  <p>But now if thou ſhalt ſay, Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as the Scriptures do teſtifie, <hi>did ſuffer all theſe things, and fulfilled them in his example,</hi> yet is it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any one can imitate him in ſuch <hi>ſtreights</hi> and <hi>deſertion;</hi> it is anſwered, Chriſt himſelf hath ſaid, <hi>He that taketh
<pb facs="tcp:137210:5"/>not up his Croſs, and cometh after me, cannot be my diſciple, nor is he worthy of me.</hi> Alſo <hi>Peter</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>Chriſt hath ſuffered for us, leaving us an example, that we might follow his ſteps.</hi> Now if this were impoſſible, would not theſe and the like Sayings, read every where, up and down the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, be in vain? But what doth <hi>Paul</hi> ſay? <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me;</hi> and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible with men, is poſſible with God. For he worketh in us both to wil and to do.</hi> Yield thy ſelf therefore to God, and commit thy cauſe unto him, O man, and hope in him, that he will perform and fulfill all things in thee; for he alwaies, even from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World, even to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day hath put an end to the <hi>combats</hi> of his People<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and he is <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>ſuffereth</hi> no man to be <hi>tempted beyond
<pb facs="tcp:137210:5"/>what he is able to bear.</hi> Never yet did ſuch miſery touch his <hi>Elect,</hi> but he ſtill, together with the Temptation, found out a way to eſcape. As it is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the Example of the <hi>Patriarchs, Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who all (as alſo the Author of theſe Sayings) were led through Fire and Water, through miſeries and ſtreights, and through a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal deſertion (yet every one according to his meaſure) ſo as they became as Gold purified in the fire, and were purged from their ſins. Alas, how vaſtly great was that micſey, in which <hi>David</hi> cried out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd complained: <hi>the ſorrows of death have compaſſed me about, and the torments of Hell have made me affraid, the ſnares of death have laid hold upon me.</hi> Alſo when <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> for meer anxiety and deſertion, curſed the day of his nativity; as we may read them in their own places. And who can expreſs in words that both internal
<pb facs="tcp:137210:6"/>and external miſery wherewith <hi>Job</hi> was afflicted from the Lord. Who <hi>will give unto me this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that thou mayeſt cover me in Hell or the Grave: My dwelling is in Hell or the grave, and I have made my bed in darkneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo in another place, by reaſon of his continual deſertion, he openly curſed the day of his birth, as did <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> to many more ſuch like may we turn thoroughout that whole book. And if any one ſhall yet deſire more te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, let him ſearch the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: for it is all every where full of this doctrine, that Chriſt and all his members even from <hi>Abel</hi> down to theſe times, have always trod in this path. If therefore any one ſhall thorough the grace of God, believe this, to him, I hope, this ſmall treatiſe will be very ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and profitable. But unleſs every one himſelf ſhall hear &amp; learn this of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, theſe teſtimonies nor any others will
<pb facs="tcp:137210:6"/>never help him, no not the whole Bible with all its quotations. <hi>Chriſt crucified was always a ſcandal to the Jews, and fooliſhneſs to the Gentiles, but to them that believe, he is the power of God: Bleſſed is every one,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>who ſhall not be offended in me.</hi> Which being ſaid, I ſhall now put an end to this Preface. <hi>O Lord who by thy grace art able to kill, and to make alive, to lead down into Hell, or the grave, and to bring forth from thence again; ſhew to us thy mercy, and grant us freely thy Salvation. <hi>Amen</hi>

                        <p>SUch as is the ſtate of a Man, ſo he underſtandeth the holy Scripture: if he be ſtill in nature, he interprets their Meaning to be of natural things: but if he is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended Higher, he underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them of things more Sublime: and by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:137210:8"/>how much the Higher he goes, he finds in the Scriptures ſo much the more Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Teſtimonies of things. Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low are the Image and Similitude of things above: if therefore a Man is ſtill in the loweſt degree, the Scripture propounds to him the loweſt Matters: but if he be got up into things above, the Scriptures ſheweth to him ſuperiour Matters.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>Not in riotous feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and drunkenneſs, not in chamberings and wantonneſs,</hi> &amp;c. in the 13 <hi>to the Rom.</hi> 19. That concerns a man according to the various ſtate of his Life, either litteral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or ſpiritually: if he liveth carnally, it is to be underſtood of the groſs fleſh: but if he liveth ſpiritually, fleſh alſo is thereby meant; but a more refined ſort of fleſh, to which alſo he muſt die: But before he can die to it, it's Neceſſary he ſhould firſt have lived thereunto; and he cannot firſt have lived thereunto, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs firſt he hath died unto the more groſs carnallity.</p>
                        <p>It is impoſſible for a Man to be able to underſtand this Sublime way of dying, before he is come up unto that degree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <pb n="3" facs="tcp:137210:8"/>Now if any one is come up thither, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a notional underſtanding thereof, then in the true eſſence of the thing, he is in very great danger of wandering into errour.</p>
                        <p>The ſpiritual Life of fleſh is moſt clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed in that <hi>Rich man who lived Sumptuouſly and was cloathed in Scarlet:</hi> When on the contrary, <hi>Lazarus lay Poor, Hungry, Naked and full of Sores.</hi> But what came it too? the higheſt riches were brought unto the loweſt poverty, and the loweſt poverty was changed into the higheſt Riches.</p>
                        <p>Chriſt ſayeth, <hi>John</hi> 12.32. <hi>When I ſhall be lifted up from the Earth I will draw all unto me:</hi> There the Earth is Purified and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and made fit for God: there then a Man abides yeilded up to God, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers all in God, whatſoever he ſhall do in him. Here therefore a Man is in a ſtate of Paſſion under God, but not in a ſtate of Action, and God poſſeſſeth him for his proper own. And if a Man doth not yet poſſeſs God as his propriety, <hi>viz.</hi> whileſt he is yet alive, and not when he is dead; then is not the very bottom of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:137210:9"/>his heart as yet purged from ſin; for the root of ſin ſtill is in him, and is not as yet eradicated: But at length this bottom is made manifeſt to the Man, and ſin is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, and is condemned as ſin. When Chriſt is lifted up from the Earth, then a man ſtands in death, and the Judgment of God cometh upon him: There the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his heart is purified, and the root plucked up.</p>
                        <p>When a Man knows, that he is to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this or that, and yet Commits it, his prayers for more Sublime gifts, are not heard, for he lifts not up pure hands. Becauſe ſo long as he layeth not aſide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour things, he receiveth no virtue to omit Higher things. As long as he hath not as yet done or omitted, that which he acknowledgeth is to be omitted or done by him, ſo long are hid from him the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or omitting of more Sublime things, nor can they be acknowledged by him: But if he hath been Faithful in lower matters he ſhall be advanced to higher, if ſomethings are to be renounced by a Man, and yet he will not renounce them, then
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:137210:9"/>although he prayeth yet is he not heard, but is forced to depart empty handed.</p>

Now Chriſt alone affects that, he cleanſeth the Foundation, and takes away ſin, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:137210:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>all our endeavour, or workings, expells it by Faith only.</p>
                        <p>If Satan was ſo powerful, that he could bring in ſin, then is Chriſt much more powerful, and can both conquer and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it. He that experienceth the thing it ſelf, how Chriſt expelleth ſins, and purifieth a Man, he only truly feels the effect thereof.</p>
                        <p>Before purgation ſin may indeed be ſuppoſed, that it ſhall not break forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fruits, yet is it ſtill preſent, <hi>viz.</hi> in the bottom, and thence it muſt be removed and caſt out, if a Man would arrive at Regeneration, and Righteouſneſs be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in him, which renders a Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable and chearful to all good whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but loath and heavy to all that is evil: Even as before ſin made the Man loath and heavy to good, but ready and chearful to evil.</p>
                        <p>If evil is not omitted by and through Regeneration, nor good by and through the ſame Regeneration performed, all things are done forcibly, with regret, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our wills, whatever of evil is thus omited, or whatever of good is thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:137210:10"/>for there in that caſe is as yet no renewing, but the old evil ſtock ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, which endeavours to effect its proper works, and to produce them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to act, and is quite contrary to the new Creature. But when the Victory and Regeneration is obtained, the Man then is prone to all good which he performs, and ſlow to every evil which he omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: For whatſoever is proceeded and performed from Regeneration, that is done with delight, and if it be hindred, it breeds Sorrow or Grief.</p>

The anſwer is this: In the mind or Foundation it ſelf a Man hath not the Motions of ſin: for if the Motions of ſin were ſtill there, then were not ſin yet throughly taken away. But after that ſin is caſt out of the Mind, then it betakes it ſelf to the Members: therefore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:137210:11"/>all the Motions of ſin whatſoever, that are then excited, are only done in the Members, but not in the Mind: For ſin can no longer enter into the Mind, and becauſe that Chriſt hath ſuppreſſed it, and caſt it out thence, it muſt remain ſuppreſſed and rejected, elſe his action and work would not be conſtant and firm: But now Righteouſneſs planted in the place of ſin, which Righteouſneſs is Chriſt, who now has taken up the Man, and worketh and performeth all the mans Commiſſions of good and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of evil, but the man only yields up himſelf quietly to Chriſt, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is at reſt, and takes care of none of them which Chriſt both is and acteth in him, but he leaves all to Chriſt, to whom they belong: Moreover what praiſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever or glory Springeth from hence, he aſcrib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Before Chriſt hath borne upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the ſin of Man, and planteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into Man, and taketh up the Man,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:137210:11"/>it is neceſſary, that a man ſhould account of himſelf to be yet but a ſinner, and an unjuſt perſon, yea even in a pious Life, and holy converſation, although no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould appear in him that is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, and that, he by his own ſtudy ſhall be aſcended ſo far, as he can aſcend, even as far as it is poſſible for a man, by his own endeavours to come: yet that which is the moſt material point remains ſtill behind, in which are placed all, <hi>viz.</hi> Internal Purification, and Regeneration: and this inward Purgation without all labour or endeavour of man, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated only by Chriſt our Lord, ſo that the glory then belongs only to God, but not to Man: For otherwiſe, if that was not done above all power or operation of ours, it would not be done by Faith, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But all ſuch opinions are removed far from, a Chriſtian; in that all theſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:137210:12"/>are manifeſted to him, <hi>viz.</hi> how the matter proceedeth, and whence it ariſeth, for which cauſe alſo he remaineth in his humility, without having any Gall of Bitterneſs; or judgment to paſs upon his Neighbour. Alſo concerning his own experience, he ſpeaks not with Joy, but with great grief. Therefore our Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Regeneration, Exercitation, Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Salvation, Wiſdom; and all the reſt are placed only in the hand of God; but not in our hand, and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take them up when we will, but when God freely beſtows them on us.</p>

Nor is there any need that they ſhould uſe any force to them upon this account, but all ſuch are pleaſant to them, and are performed by them with a willing mind; for this is the Property of theſe Perſons: Juſt as the Hungry-man is prone to Eat, and the Thirſty to Drink, and the Sleepy to Sleep; for as much as they do all theſe as uncommanded and without coaction.

                        <p>In a juſt and righteous man there is alwayes a deſire of going forwards, yea he alwayes gets further and further on, and though he ſhould live long, and his dayes ſhould be almoſt without Number, yet would his Life, be alwayes in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Now they that come up thither where they think they can abide and reſt, let them eſteem that for a bad ſign. For by how much the more ſubtile or Spiritual Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do become, by ſo much alſo they become more Sublime: and by how much the more Sublime they are, by ſo much the more Subtile and Sublime is their ſufferings, which point is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unknown to them, who are yet but in ſome lower degree or ſtep.</p>
                        <p>Unleſs God ſhould more put a man forwards, then he doth put himſelf, he would never be ſaved, nor indeed be able to come to Regeneration. Now God hedgeth up on all ſides, to an elect man,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:137210:13"/>his way, that when he deviates from the right Path to his own deſtruction he hinders him, and ſets to him his bonds, and then a man comes to acknowledge, that that was nothing but the work and Commiſeration of God: and then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes really humble and Judgeth no man, but hath and beareth himſelf with a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent and Merciful mind towards all men, when he can clearly diſcern, how much miſery hung over his head, from which notwithſtanding he apprehendeth himſelf quite freed through the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mercy of God: therefore he cannot boaſt himſelf againſt them, being mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful alwayes of his own ſelf: for if God hath not ſpared them, nor perhaps will he ſpare thee. And becauſe lie Shines forth with a greater grace above others, he is not lifted up above others, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is touched with a Commiſeration and compaſſion towards them. So that if upon very urgent Neceſſity he muſt ſay ſome what of others, he doth it with fear and trembling, and but that the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of his Neighbour ſhould require it, he would more gladly hold his peace.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:137210:14"/>Yea oftentimes he purpoſeth with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for his part, to be ſilent but when time and cauſes do drive, then in truth he is forced to ſpeak, ſeeing the thing now urgeth him. And that too, not out of Envy, Hatred, or Exacerbation, but is only performed through the moving cauſe at leaſt of his Neighbour. Now before this, a man did not behold others with a benigne mind, but was unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and full of taxations againſt others: ſo that if alſo he now ſees any one that doth ſo, yet doth he bear all this with a willing mind.</p>
                        <p>Alas! how miſerable do thoſe men live, who ſeek not after God: When they have lived Thirty, Forty, Fifty, yea an Hundred Years, yet are all theſe paſſed away as it were by a blaſt, and ſo many years have ſlipped away in vain.

All this is done by God for that Man, who hath laboured ſo far, as he can get no Further on; and ſhould this Man live yet a Thouſand Years; yet he could never be able to go beyond that, except God ſhould come, and quite above his own Power, through Faith, ſhould effectually work it, and ſhould accompliſh all things in him, which the Law requireth of him, and unto which he could not come, nor of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf attain to, until God himſelf ſhould ſet theſe things before him, and in the Manner aboveſaid put or help him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.

If thou thinkeſt that thou art able by thy own Induſtry to come up thus far, I will teach thee, that it is impoſſible for thee: and then he ſhews him another Light to which a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conformable, although his Age ſhould extend it ſelf till it be equal to all Ages of the World, except God ſhould come and render him conformable to the aboveſaid Light, and that above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Study, and all working or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his own.

                        <p>That which Conſcience exhibiteth to a Man, he muſt Satisfy it, and then his Conſcience will ſhew unto him yet more, and ſo onwards until he comes into God, and is manifeſtly made ſpiritual. How</p>

Furthermore a Regenerate Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be provoked to be Angry, nor to be Proud, or of a Haughty Mind, ſeeing he himſelf is purged from ſuch like vices, and is become a New Creature, and is detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Regeneration, every ways giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up to God, and is contented with whatſoever God ſhall do with him, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to come upon him, either in time, or in eternity, either inwardly or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, either by Means, or without Means, he receives all theſe from the Hand of God; and yields the whole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of himſelf up to God.</p>

                        <p>So ſoon as ever any thing is yielded up, it loſeth that ſtrength it had to force a Man, and then it is an eaſie thing for a Man to paſs it by, which before to do, did ſeem difficult, yea impoſſible.</p>
                        <p>When a Man gives up his will to God, then he belongs to God, and if ſo be a Man is ſometimes willing to put this in Practiſe; and to abide by it, God doth otherwiſe order it for him, and will have him enjoy that which is his.

If yet ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that without his knowledge hath lurked in his Mind, that alſo ſhall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, when he repeats the Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Nor can a Man more rightly know, whether he be free or a Captive, then when he is thus touched; and therefore this Tryal is not an evil thing, nor alſo is it to be avoided, becauſe by the help of it, occult defects, are diſcovered, and the Man confeſſeth them to the Lord with Contrition, who alſo is able to purge him from them.</p>
                        <p>As long as a Man lives, he is under the Law: and when by his own Endeavours he is come ſo far, that he cannot aſcend
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:137210:24"/>higher, yet he ſhall get higher, and be advanced: But it is neceſſary he ſhould put forth his hand, that another may cloſely take hold of him, and lead him into the way, which elſe he will not find: that is, he muſt give himſelf up to God, ſo, as that he ſuffers him only to operate, he himſelf only ſitting ſtill, and Submitting himſelf unto God. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver then is performed, that is no longer done by Man, but God himſelf worketh above all actions of Man, or his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or Power: God acts, and Man ſuffers: if this be done, God by ſuch ſufferings and dyings, leadeth and exerciſeth the Man, which are matters far ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his ſtrength and knowledge, even as before alſo the thing was utterly unknown to him, nor was it poſſible for him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſuch a thing, or exerciſe himſelf in it. And in this death it is that a Man is purged, and all things are taken from him, all Whatever were able to hinder in him the undertaking of the true eſſence. Then is all propriety and Nature renounced, for in God is no propriety, but all things ought to be of a Divine Nature nor can any
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:137210:25"/>other Nature be brought into God. In that death the Soul is loſt: and when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this is done, then a Man cometh to the true eſſential Life of God, and there Chriſt revealeth himſelf moſt Evidently in Man, and then there is no need to ſearch many things concerning the Place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſt is to be worſhipped, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch Particulars, becauſe all theſe will be very perſpicuous, or known, to our eyes.</p>
                        <p>The Law is fulfiled by the new Man without all diſpute or Imagination, Jeſus hath ſtrength enough to be able to ſave and Purify a Man from ſin: but Chriſt doth alſo anoint the Man thus purified with his Holy Spirit.</p>

For he acknowledgeth it was the alone Mercy of God, which ſo exerciſeth him, and brought him back from Death to Life, which Mercy he could not acknowledge, when he was ſtill under the Law, for there his Propriety, and his ſelfneſs was yet preſent, but the Commiſeration of the Lord was hitherto unknown to him, becauſe he had not as yet been thus exerciſed by God, above all Operation and Power of his own, that he might come to the Denial of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but he ſtood as yet under the Law, being touched by no Death, when he thought that a reward ought to be Given him out of Deſert, but not out of Grace; and then it was, that he ſought to Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his own Righteouſneſs, but ſuch a Righteouſneſs was unknown to him, which above and beyond all his own
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:137210:26"/>Operation and Power was ſetled only by Faith in Chriſt, which Faith is acquired only in Death, Darkneſs, and Hell or the Grave.</p>
                        <p>A Man, in whom the Law hath exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed all its Power, and hath ſlain him, remains not in Death, but by the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt is raiſed up again into a New Life, but is not raiſed up again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Old Life: for when he ſhould hang with Chriſt upon the Croſs, and beg to be Freed, that he might return again into that Life, he is not Heard, but he muſt dye then, not can he ever be thus made alive again: but by the Reſurrection of Chriſt, riſeth into a New Life.</p>
                        <p>Here the matter is ſo carried, as if the Thief on the right Hand, and the other on the Left, and Chriſt alſo, did Hang Naked on the Croſs in one Man, and as if he was reviled by both of them; for faith the Evengeliſt: Which very thing alſo did the Thieves, who were crucified with Him, reproach him withal.

Chriſt ſaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Croſs to the Thief on his Right-hand: <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> He did not ſay, Thou art with me in Paradiſe, for this could not be, ſo long as he had not yet dyed: but he ſaid thus, Thou ſhalt he with me in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> When thou haſt ſuffered Death: for it is as equally Impoſſible that a Man who is not yet dead, can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in God, as it is Impoſſible, that a Hundred Pound Weight of Lead ſhould Fly upwards unto the Sky.</p>

                        <p>GOd cometh and openeth to a Man the ſence of Scripture, as it were in one Moment, like lightning, which comes, as it were in one moment, and goes away again in another, and then a Man acknowledgeth the ſence of Scripture to be far otherwiſe, then before, when he had conſidered it in his own ſtrength. And thus God can effect more in one only Moment for the truer underſtanding of the ſence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then all the Epiſtles which ſome can write to others. When the Light cometh, in proceſs of time it becomes clearer and clearer, and again alſo it is wont to return again yet more clear, ſo that more is ſtill diſcovered and Manifeſted to a man, which before now lay hid from him. If
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:137210:27"/>this firſt Claritude cometh into a man as if it were Angelical, but then forward it ruſheth in, much clearer, and ſo a Man gets from one degree of Angelical Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to another Higher degree of the ſame, and then preſently he aſcendeth yet High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, until he arriveth at the Claritude or Light, which is God himſelf, without the Interpoſition of the light Angelical: and then God co-uniteth all the foregoing Lights in his own Light (which is nothing elſe but himſelf) and a man is made ſo ſure and Certain from God, who is that very Light, that this degree of his Light is God himſelf, and not Angelical Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that he needs not ask others, who have experienced it: for God brings with him that certainty when he comes. But before this Light cometh, which is God himſelf, thoſe Angelical Lights do firſt appear, and do as it were prepare the way for the true Light: for if this true Light ſhould come without ſending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it thoſe enlightenings, a Man could not bear it. But the Angelical Light is ſuch, whereby a Man rejoyceth for a ſhort time, Juſt as Chriſt ſaid of <hi>John:</hi>

When the Angelick Light com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, many miſtake, thinking it to be that Eternal Light, which is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; yet is it not ſo, the reaſon of which may be obſerved to be this, if one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up to a greater Light, the foregoing is not cared for: and if yet he gets up to a Higher Light, alſo that that went before it, is no more accounted of. If therefore thoſe Lights were God himſelf in his own Claritude, without the Interpoſition of the Angelick Light, it could not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, but they would be alwayes Highly eſteemed of, and would never be deprived of their Eſtimation.</p>
                        <p>A man who is arrived at God, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Angels, for he paſſed thorough all the Angels into the Son. A man muſt paſs thorough a Combate, a Death, and the Grave to come unto God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is no need of the Angels, in as much as they do Contemplate and uſe, without a Death, that Eternal good. Now the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:137210:28"/>Angels were appointed unto the Service of Men. When therefore a Man does Contemplate on theſe Lights, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, he muſt Sedulouſly beware, leſt he break out by ſpeaking or teaching thereof, but to wait with Silence and Calmneſs for his Advancement, and be Internally Sollicitous concerning thoſe Gifts. But if he do break forth, he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably hinders himſelf, and renders him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unworthy of theſe Gifts, and abuſeth them, and as it were Prodigally throws all away with Pleaſure, Singularity and Pride. There are alſo falſe Lights which ſhine in a Man, and give him an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and do unfold the ſayings of Scripture. Yea even Satan is wont to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear under the Shape of an Angel of Light: and all theſe are done in a Man. Here therefore a Man is to have a care, leaſt he miſtake theſe for Divine Lights, and if he be in doubt, whether they be Divine or not, there is need only of Silence, for he cannot err by being Silent, whether that Light be Divine, or whether it be falſe. But by how much the purer is the Zeal of a Man, by ſo much the leſs do

                        <p>The Judgment of God reacheth all the Creatures that exiſt in Man, and many, whilſt all is well with them, would ruſh into various Errours, unleſs the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God did hang over the Head of Man.</p>
                        <p>For every particular iniquity the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God is to be expected, for the Juſt God hears and ſees all, and obſerves every word, and will puniſh for it: Let therefore a man fear and beware of God. Even as Chriſt will exerciſe Judgment on the Earth: ſo alſo is there a Spiritual ſignification of that particular, <hi>viz.</hi> That the very ſame ſhall be done in a man, and there alſo will he puniſh and ſuppreſs all iniquity. We have a Similitude of this in Wax. Soft wax is capable to receive all Impreſſions: but that which is hard muſt be put into the Fire. For as the Earth is reſerved laſt for the Fire; ſo in like manner is the Heart of man.</p>
                        <p>If there happen to a man Reproach, Diſgrace, Loſs, Revilings, and other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, all theſe are, according to Chriſt's Example, to be endured with Patience, nor muſt ſuch Complain, or Murmur,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:137210:35"/>or Judge. Many are much troubled, if they be injured, but if they could bear it Patiently, they would do better, and pleaſe God. When a man can by his own loſt, turn away the loſs of another, he ought to ſuffer his own proper loſs, that that others loſs may be prevented. And this point is to be learned thorough Tribulation and Griefs, otherwiſe it will never bring forth fruit: They who thus deſire the inward Croſs, that ſo they may be freed from the Eternal, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo have not the inward one: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſeek it, yet they cannot find it. They reject the external, and therefore the internal cannot be taken up by them.</p>
                        <p>The ſtate of Chriſtians is of all men in the Earth, the moſt miſerable Eſtate, and the moſt Subject to ſufferings. If a Chriſtian's inſide could be beheld, no man would deſire his Condition.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:137210:35"/>belong unto him. On the other hand alſo, if any man amongſt all thoſe who live in the World, is found to be chearful and merry, certainly that alſo does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Chriſtian. The countenance of Chriſt is ſo dejected and Harſh, that he who ſees him, will refuſe him.</p>
                        <p>It is certainly no ſmall affliction to have all that caſt away, which we have wrought for with all our Labour: yet after that, God on a Sudden raiſeth up ſomewhat, which can ſtand in his Sight: and then it is, that God worketh in a man, but the man himſelf is at Reſt from work: whatſoever then is in the man, and ſhineth forth from him, all that is God, and the man himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to God, and therefore we are not to look at the Perſon which is the man, but God who is in him, (as I may ſay) is made man in him, and putteth him on, and is and worketh all things in him, and Shineth forth thorough him.</p>
                        <p>A man that adhereth to the Earth, hath joy: and he that adheres to Heaven alſo, hath joy: but he that is between both theſe, and toucheth neither of them, is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:137210:36"/>affected with great Dolours, and hath nothing that may uphold him.</p>
                        <p>A man alwayes hath ſomewhat, which he thinks is yet to come hereafter, and he waits for it with joy: but where there is no ſuch Expectation, there is nothing but Affliction: and even this muſt be ſent from God into the man, if it is to beget in him any breathings. A man muſt come ſo far, that all things do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, before he can be promoted further. And if this caſe is brought forth, as in Relation to the Groſſer Creature, it afterwards returns alſo more ſubtile, as to that Claritude called Angelick: yea and more ſubtile as to God himſelf, if he can be injoyed without Angels.</p>
                        <p>Although we muſt thus ſtand in deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, periſh ſo often, and looſe our ſelves as to the Creature, Angels, and God, and ſo every one ought by and thorough deſertion to be Sowen, Corrupted, and to conceive Fruit, and again to be Sown yet in the concluſion the buiſineſs will come to the beſt Iſſue and the man ſhall be everlaſtingly preſerved and quieted in God, when he ſhall bring forth Frui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He that is not Dead, cannot exerciſe himſelf in the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, but before that, he muſt ſuffer Patiently, that he may be Exerciſed in the Paſſion and Death of Chriſt. If the Magiſtrate can ſo puniſh a Malefactor, that he ſhall tranſgreſs no more, how much more ſhall God do the ſame.</p>

Wherefore be ye turned from the Shadow to the Truth, whoever you be that deſire to live, and to have both true Peace and true Joy to all Eternity. The whole world, and all Creatures are but the Image only of the Eſſence, and of the inward Truth of things: Yea, God alſo hath Created the Creatures in their order, ſo, as they may rejoyce in their corporal order, and ſo likewiſe are they the Image of the internal Truth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as that alſo hath its own Spiritual or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

                        <p>WHen the Lord ſaid to the younger Son, <hi>My Son, go and Work in the Vineyard to day,</hi> and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: <hi>I go Lord:</hi> but coming unto the Elder, he alſo ſaid, <hi>Go Work in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard:</hi> and he anſwered, <hi>I will not:</hi> Thoſe two Sons are but one Man. For when a man begins, he will do all, he will Suppreſs ſin, purifie himſelf, he will Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Love, and adore God, and adhere unto him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He thinks that he is able to perform all this. But when the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs comes to Trial, then a man at laſt apprehendeth, that he can ſcarcely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the outward ſhow of Virtue or Righteouſneſs, and that alſo with much indignation and reluctancy, becauſe he hath not that true eſſential Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Virtue, whence true deſire ſpringeth.</p>
                        <p>For it is eſſential virtue only that makes a man pleaſant, and willing to do
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:137210:38"/>whatſoever he is to do, and to omit, whatſoever he is to omit: and if this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue be eſſentially in him, then is he more backward and full of loathing againſt Vice, then he was before againſt Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, when Vice was yet in the Throne. Therefore unleſs the very root of Vices and of Unrighteouſneſs, whence external wickedneſſes do Spring, as the Fruits of a corrupt Tree, be purged out, no true Virtue, or real and Subſtantial Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs can grow forth in a man. And therefore all men are Liars, and have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the outſide-ſhew of Righteouſneſs, without the true eſſence of the thing: for the thing comes not forth out of the mind, becauſe the mind hath not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: For the Heart of that man that is full of any thing, the man himſelf is the moſt Subjected ſervant to that thing. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſin is not heartily or from the mind omitted (as being yet in the mind) though as to ſhew it may be omitted. I ſay not all this for this Purpoſe, that a man ought to wait ſo long to omit the ſhew of the Vices, and perform a ſhew of vertue, till Vice inwardly alſo be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:137210:39"/>and eſſential virtue Implanted: but that none ſhould remain contented, if, as to the ſhew only, he omitteth Vice and have the Poſſeſſion of Virtue; nor that then he account of himſelf for a Juſt man, or ſhould think, that he hath then ſo fulfilled Righteouſneſs, and to have departed from ſin: For we muſt Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Pray both by Night and by Day, that it be omitted Heartily or out of the Mind, which externally is omitted as to the ſhew thereof. But the truth is, that is not the work of man, but of God only: for it is not Poſſible for any man to extirpate ſin from the Root it ſelf, but a man can ſuffer only, that God may do that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his faithful Promiſes. If a man could perform that thing, it would not be a conſtant or an abiding thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whatſoever a man doth, is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and is annihilated again by man: If therefore a man ſhould ſuppreſs ſin, it would again Bud forth, for the work of a man is not Permanent, or laſting, but may be broke off by others. But that which God worketh, is Subject to no Deſtruction.</p>

                        <p>THis is the meaning of the Parable of the two Sons, who ſhould go and labour in the Vineyard, he that would not do it, he did it, that is, he came ſo far as to confeſs: that it was impoſſible for him to extirpate ſin, and to implant Righteouſneſs. And when he thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came deficient in himſelf, and deſpaired thereof, he waited for the Gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, <hi>viz.</hi> that God himſelf would do that, when it proved Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for man to do it. And that ſame will, to perform, of the firſt Son and all his other Actions and Omiſſions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed (as to ſhew) are prefigured by <hi>Abraham's</hi> begetting <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> for he brought him forth by working, he himſelf doing it: but he was according to the fleſh: But he could not produce <hi>Iſaac</hi>
                           <pb n="66" facs="tcp:137210:40"/>by working; for as to him, he was to wait on the Promiſe of God, <hi>viz.</hi> That God himſelf ſhould work it, and he be born after the Spirit. And when theſe things are fulfilled, whatever is to be omitted, is omitted without labour; and whatever is done, is done without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, for the Lord hath willing Servants, who do all willingly and omit alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which at firſt made a man back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and loath, is extirpated, and in its room righteouſneſs is implanted.</p>
                        <p>To reſiſt the breaking out of ſins by the law of ſin, and to have a ſhow of vertue, cannot be done with man's work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the extirpation of ſins, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation of righteouſneſs is done without mans working, according to the word of promiſe w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is to be expected with deſire: if this ſhall once come upon us, it cannot be again ſuppreſſed, but muſt remain eternally. Before Chriſt, comes the Law and makes a man contrite and and ſorrowful, ſo as if a Man will ſubmit unto it, he will deſire Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>That which the Law ſhews, it does not take away; and that which it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:137210:40"/>it doth not give. But at length Chriſt cometh and taketh away what the Law had diſcovered, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin, and he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planeth what the Law had commanded, <hi>viz.</hi> Righteouſneſs, therefore Chriſt comes at laſt, and he doth all this: and then begins in man the time of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, that in him all things may be fulfilled and confirmed, which had been promiſed of Chriſt; but before this, he lived under the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> in the time of the Old Teſtament, and wanted Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>The Friends of God live in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual death of the fleſh, but in mind they live, and are free.

Now this forſaking is the image of thoſe things, which alſo muſt, beſides theſe be forſaken: for all that is gotten out of them, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe fruits which are ſprung forth out of the corruption of earthly things, are alſo to be corrupted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently thoſe good things alſo are to be forſaken; but out of that forſaking are ſtill gotten other greater goods, and more high fruits, which again muſt be ſubjected to corruption, whence afterwards other

And by how much the Higher he aſcended into this Life, ſo much the Higher alſo was he ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, as to new Deaths.</p>
                        <p>We forſake the Body, becauſe we found it before in <hi>Adam:</hi> if alſo we muſt forſake our Soul, that alſo muſt firſt be

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:137210:47"/>to door, and it is ſtill ſaid to him; God look upon thee; ſo alſo is it done with a man, who falls into this miſery, all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to which ſoever he approacheth, refuſe him; ſo that at length God only muſt help and ſave him. When all things ſtand at great diſtance, that there remains no more underpropping, or refuge, then is the Lord urged to come in: for God cometh not; unleſs he be urged. A man muſt be left naked, and ſtript of all things, if God only muſt be made his eſſential life and prop. Alſo in deſertion it cannot be but God will come. When God begins to purge the floor of ſin, and to root it up from the bottom, then it is, that, at laſt, a man begins to know himſelf; and he is in his own ſight, what he is in truth, and what he was both before, and after that; and that which now is required is plainly another thing, then what he thought formerly, when he was ſtill under the works of the Law: and it repenteth him much, that he ever had eſteemed himſelf for a Godly man, becauſe he acknowledgeth the contrary now, <hi>viz.</hi> that he hath
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:137210:47"/>been a ſinner and an unrighteous man, but not a good man. And now God taketh violent hold on the root it ſelf, to pluck it up. But what a ſtroak this is, any one may know, who will experience the very thing it ſelf. When a man burneth with zeal, and is willing to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy himſelf, then in the end is he become impure and unrighteous, for then God diſcovers to him the very foundation it ſelf of wickedneſs, and ſets before his eyes that which was from the beginning. There therefore muſt the man abide, and ſtand in the examination. In that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Croſs, nothing can relieve a man, and what was before told him of that croſs, he can not now own it, that this is that very caſe: True indeed he wiſheth: O that this were it! and yet he judgeth that this his ſuffering is plainly ſome other thing, till God bringeth him forth, as purged, or cleanſed. And then he is cloathed with Righteouſneſs, and is tranſlated into the true eſſence: then alſo he hath utterly loſt himſelf, yea and all that alſo wherein he ſought himſelf, and is made one with God, who is made
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:137210:48"/>unto him all things. Formerly he ſought to ſave his Soul, alwayes fearing leſt he ſhould loſe it: but now he ſtands in the hand of God, given up to God, and with him, and out of him, God doth what he pleaſeth, both in time, and in eternity; for he acquieſceth in all things and deſireth nothing, but that the will of God may be done in him.</p>

                        <p>WHen ſin is diſcovered to a man, then it ſeemeth to him to be as it were a Sword, at which he is frighted, and fleeth to God; and ſo Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is kill'd by his own Sword. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>From out of many ſins, Righteouſneſs is manifeſted:</hi> when ſins are multiplied, that is, when the multitude and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſins become known to a man, then he turns his back at laſt upon ſin, and goes to God, who delivers him from it, and in the place of ſin, manifeſteth to him his own Righteouſneſs; for as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times many Hounds purſue after one
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:137210:48"/>Hare, when the Dogs are taken off, the Beaſt is freed and remains alone, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo God doth with the multitude of ſins, ſo as they all at laſt leave following a man. Therefore it is written in the <hi>Pſalms: A thouſand ſhall fall at thy ſide, and ten thouſand at thy right hand,</hi> and they ſhall not come near thee. This falling of thouſands and ten thouſands is done in man, but it approacheth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a man, but he is kept upright in God, and is taken into his glory. And then he becomes as if he were not; he is, as it were, ſo wholly deified, that he can find nothing but God, neither himſelf, nor any creature. And when he is thus in an exſtaſie and in a rapture above, then is he void of diſcretion and without reaſon. Not as though they were not ſtill in being in him, but that he is not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of them, until he returns into his mind again: but it is a pain to him, that he is forced to deſcend again into diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For it was a great bitterneſs to <hi>Paul,</hi> that he was forced to return back into diſcretion for the ſake of his Brethren.</p>

                           <hi>Paul's</hi> ſin. Experience is the mother of underſtanding. If one hath once taſted Hony, he needs not to be told, that Hony is Sweet. He that ſeeth a white thing, there is no need to ſay unto him, that thing is white, for he will anſwer, what need is there to tell me that, when I my ſelf both ſee, and underſtand the very thing. He that hath the very thing it ſelf ſtands in no need of the type or ſhaddow of that thing.</p>

                        <p>CHriſt deſcended ſo low, as we alſo are to come down: he went no lower, but he ariſeth much higher then we can: Now can we alſo poſſibly come into that depth, unleſs firſt we ſhall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at exaltation. Man hath Chriſt firſt in Nature, and alwayes receives him more ſublime, yet ſo, as what hath gone before, is ſtill ſown again, to ſpring up into a more noble plant, ſo that at length man receiveth Chriſt without all or any creature. Thus man is alwayes aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:137210:49"/>by and thorough the creatures, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he hath found Chriſt without the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. A man aſcends by the Angels un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Son, who gives him up unto the Father. Generation proceeds from one degree unto another, until one climeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things into Eternity: and there generation endeth, for there is the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal abyſs, in which he is wholly ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up: and he who arrives ſo far, knows all things in a conſtant Idea, out of which God ſnatcheth him, and he alwayes ſees moſt clearly, by what degrees God was preſent with him, and therefore he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in a perpetual giving of thanks. Alſo in ſuch a claritude and viſion of God, he is in a perpetual death, and is, as it were, ſome hungring Soul to whom it is not lawful to eat of Meats ſet before him. But if he doth throw his life into danger and doth eat, then muſt he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain dye a new death: therefore ſuch kind of men are both poor and rich: for though they are in the boſome of all comfort, yet they want all comfort, ſo alſo they, in jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:137210:50"/>they, who are poor in ſpirit, who have not whereon to lay their heads, and dare touch nothing, and ſtand they do, as it were, upon a round Globe; yet they have wings, but know it not. As to themſelves, they are altogether diſtitute of all ſecurity: but in God's ſight they are ſecure. Whereas they, who are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in themſelves, want ſecurity before God. This ſtate is not the ſtate of <hi>Eſau,</hi> but of <hi>Jacob:</hi> for <hi>Eſau</hi> hath God for his propriety, but God hath <hi>Jacob</hi> for his own propriety, who ſtands in being giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up to God, becauſe God hath made him fit, and capable, and hath reduced him to obedience, and therefore the man poſſeſſeth God with acquieſcence and in the midſt of all riches, and glory, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts himſelf a poor wretch, he is qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly ſatisfied in all things which God ſhall do: If he gives him Heaven, he is quetly pleaſed: if he caſt him into hell it ſelf, he bears it patiently, and ſtill continueth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned up to the will of God: alſo what things ſoever God puts upon him by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, he receives them all as from God, and hath nothing to do with men,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:137210:50"/>but with God, who does all theſe things by means of men: therefore is he at peace with all men, and can hate no man, for any adverſity done unto him: for he takes it from God, and not from Man, whom he ſtill looks upon, but as on inſtruments, by which God worketh, as when a trumpet ſoundeth, it is not the trumpet maketh the ſound, but the Trumpeter. Hence it follows, that he ſtandeth in a willing patience againſt all, that can happen unto him by men: ſo that if they hate him, blaſpheme him, injury him, hinder him, puniſh him, revile him, detract from his reputation, take away his goods, his friends, his houſe, and do perſecute him, captivate him, bind him on wracks, torment and kill him, he takes all theſe from the hand of God alone, and hath no buſineſs with men, and in all theſe he looks upon God only, and not upon Men; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth to all perſons and can take all in good part. So alſo on the contrary, if any one good happeneth to him from men, he takes all that alſo from God, becauſe he hath taken off his eyes from
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:137210:51"/>all means, and hath fixed them upon God alone, he alſo hath no reſpect of perſons, which God hath withdrawn from him, and hath given him the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that he can behold God in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of man, and can take all things from his hands. And ſo he can give all glory to God, and is a true worſhipper of him.</p>

It alſo behooves this man to remain in judgment, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fleſh, till, as to that, he ſhall be dead: Nor ſhall he ever be raiſed up again into that life, according to which he hath dyed, but he is eternally to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it, out of, or from that juſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Whilſt therefore we are not yet dead, but are yet alive, we ought to be lifted up on the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:137210:54"/>croſs, and lay down ſuch a life under a juſt judgment. For elſe we cannot be converſant in or with the ſight of God, unleſs when we lye down in death: and our converſation which is without death, is no converſation in the ſight of God, and though in the ſight of Men it may have a ſemblance, yet it cannot ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. But when life is, as was ſaid, ſo laid down, we are by the reſurrection of Chriſt raiſed up again into a new life: for unleſs the reſurrection of Chriſt ſhould be, we ſhould remain eternally in death. When the thief on the right hand, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all, did turn himſelf unto Chriſt, he begged to be heard of him in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

The firſt purification of a man is by working under the Law: the ſecond by Chriſt under Grace.

                        <p>THe new man doth all things out of, or from regeneration. He hath no need to go firſt, and hear, or read, what he is to do or to leave undone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all his things proceed out of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                        <p>To a regenerate Man, who worketh and exerciſeth himſelf in God, eating, and drinking, and ſleeping, and every temporal need begets trouble and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety.</p>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:137210:59"/>
                        <p>He who hath regeneration it ſelf, and is come into the eſſence of God, reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf within bounds, nor does he act as formerly, when he had the thing only in notion.</p>
                        <p>There is no need to command a man newly born, that he ſhould live, and ſee, and eat, and drink, and ſleep, and wake, and deſire, and go, and ſtand, and ſpeak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for he does all theſe things unbidden; by nature, for it is his eſſence and property: that which he outwardly hears and ſees, is only the expreſſion of himſelf: for he derives none of theſe from elſewhere, for he had them before, and it is his nature, and he thus acteth freely. Nor is it needful, that it ſhould be told him, what a man is, or what it is to live, to eat, to drink, to ſleep, to wake, to deſire, to ſtand, to go, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for he knows all theſe by his own proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. But on the contrary, a man that is not yet born, knows not what a man is, or what it is to live, to eat, to drink, to ſleep, to watch, to deſire, to go, to ſtand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither can it ſo be propounded to him, that he may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:137210:59"/>it, or by expreſſion have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him. The like, to this, may be ſaid of a man born of God, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things by his own proper experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whatever the Scriptures teſtify and expreſs: for all that, is his nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and nothing is adverſe to him, which he cannot freely do. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is no longer under the Law: He knows by his experience, the wayes, by which we are led to regeneration, or what regeneration, or a man new born again, is; as alſo what is his life, his food his drink, his exerciſe, his work, his going, his ſtanding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of theſe things there is no need, that any of them ſhould be commanded to him, for he hath all things of himſelf, and they are his propriety, beſides he freely and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly doth them, nor can he do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. There is no need to tell a Lover, what Love is, nor a Godly man, what Godlineſs is: and becauſe he is ſo come unto the very eſſence of things, that they are become his habit and uſe, and being always preſent with him, he cannot then be angry, though he be contradicted,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:137210:60"/>and the matter is not believed by men, for elſe he knows and is ſenſible of the thing, and that he, who is againſt him, ought to be ſubjected to his Judgment. He who is fully ſound in health cannot be angry, nor grieved, though one ſhould ſay to him, that he is ſick, for he feels that it is otherwiſe; but he who hath the thing only in notion, but not in ſubſtance, cannot bear contradictions, and affronts.</p>
                        <p>Before we arrive at regeneration, we muſt be drag'd thorough an unknown, forſaken, and deſolate path, and God pulls a man by this way, againſt his will. For when a man laboured under the Law, ſo that he could advance no further, and ſuppoſed that he was now arrived at the end of his journey, then at length muſt he journey, and be hurried thorough this unknown way. The firſt way was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and full of freſh-green herbs, though it alſo ſeemed difficult, and a man thought, that the end thereof would be God: Yet the end proved to be no other then this aforeſaid rough-way, which is Purgatory, in which a man is purged from all things, which are of the fleſh: God indeed draws
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:137210:60"/>a man hither and thither in this way, and ſtill ſome ſmall piece of fleſh is torn off, here, or there, till it be left quite bare, and nothing but Spirit remains. Then the man willingly yields himſelf up into the hands of God, and into thoſe ſufferings, becauſe the carnal affections are thus conſumed in this purgatory, ſo that there is nothing remains but Spirit. Then God cometh, and applyeth himſelf unto man, and gives himſelf to be known of man, and ſo this man comes at length to arrive at true ſubſtance or eſſence, of which he is made capable by this ſuffering, for in this ſuffering, or purgatory, he is fully purged, and made fit to receive God. When God is willing to help us, then he exerciſeth us with this ſuffering, when all exerciſes, and all ſtrength of our own faileth, even then are theſe the exerciſes of God, and his ſtrength. When all our ſtrength is vaniſhed away, and we have ſo long laboured under the Law, that we can do no more, then is God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, whether we will or no; for here a man muſt go on, nor is it permitted him to go back again: for he is in the hand
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:137210:61"/>of the Lord, into which he often deſired to come; and that hand will not then let him go, till it hath rightly broken him in pieces, by afflictions, and hath tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him up and down thorough various caſes. Whence it comes, that healwayes more and more, loſeth himſelf, till he be freed from all his fleſh, and is made capable of the heavenly influence. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are who are not thus exerciſed, but abide in their own labour, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be advanced higher, but ſtand at a ſtay always in the ſame ſtate; and if one ſhall return after the ſpace of a year, or two years, yea of ten, unto them he ſhall find them ſtill, as he formerly left them, how much ſoever they exerciſe themſelves under the Law, and ſeverity, and good works, and labours, and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and abſtinence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet they all ſtop their courſe here, being ſtill inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unchanged, and unregenerated, and of the new creature or regeneration know nothing, becauſe they are not exerciſed in the hand of the Lord, by means of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid ſufferings: for affliction alone is this way to the new Generation, to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:137210:61"/>Wiſdom, and to true Knowledge. The aforeſaid labour alſo muſt be under the Law, yea and go before that other (elſe we cannot arrive at the ſaid ſtate of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering) ſo that no one abides therein: for the mind is not yet ſo purified, and there ſtill ſticketh unto its bottom ſomewhat that is worldly, though one may appear otherwiſe outwardly. Conſequently, we become not in our minds, partakers with Chriſt, until, being purified by that purgatory, and theſe ſufferings, we are made capable of him: for light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Chriſt and <hi>Belial</hi> dwell not together. Thoſe middle things, which are interpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between God and us, and unto which we always remain fixedly holding our eye, ſo as we cannot ſee God; thoſe mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle things (I ſay) are to be removed, by the means of ſufferings from God, if we are to be united to him. If Gold could be ſenſible, and ſpeak, it would certainly ſay what it ſhould ſuffer, before it could be purified, and ſo the Earth would ſay, how much it muſt ſuffer, and how much it would ſtand in need of, before the ſeed is produced out of its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:137210:62"/>When a man hath brought all his labours to an end, nor cannot go on further, then is the chiefeſt and higheſt work yet before his hands, lying as undone. If this muſt be perfected and done, it muſt be done by God; for it behooveth that he ſhould accompliſh theſe things, which are impoſſible for a man to do.</p>

                        <p>When a man acknowledges, that he is the moſt inferior of all, and lets all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove himſelf, and that he is the moſt fooliſh, unworthy, and the moſt vain of all, then is he neareſt to his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and ſuch as he beholds himſelf, ſuch alſo he is.

                        <p>TO abſtain and repreſs ones ſelf, is no death in reſpect of my death: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is done out of purpoſe, but this without and beyond all purpoſes: yet not ſo, as if the will of God were not pleaſing to me. God hath led me vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently. To be thus lead is the work of God, nor is it done unleſs God wills. In the agony of death many things are often done, which are not done in the life's time. In the agony of death is exerciſed a hard judgment, and then is a man ſometimes promoted therein, to which he could never come before in all the time of his whole life. Firſt he muſt conflict with joy, then with ſorrow, and laſtly with death. Whatſoever words are ſpoken without experience, I have no eſteem of them. If I had known that this miſery, in which I now live was to come upon me, I had periſhed: but now that I am in it, God holdeth me in it. God holdeth
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:137210:72"/>me privately, I knowing it not.</p>
                        <p>The Creature which is rightly uſed, is made more noble and cometh to God: thus every creature muſt return to its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, that is, to God, and this is done by that man, who abideth in a right way. The true uſe of the creatures is performed with giving of thanks: therefore except one rightly uſeth the creature, he uſeth it to judgment.</p>
                        <p>Concupiſcence is a thing ſo ſecretly hidden in Man, that a Man knows not whither it be concupiſcence or not, till for its ſake he be lead away captive. By how much any one is nearer to God, by ſo much the more pitiful is his internal condition. To know God, is a ſtate the moſt ſubjected to affliction of all: By how much any one is nearer to God, by ſo much the higher is he in ſufferings. To know God is indeed a bitter ſtate, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the departure of the creature, which for his ſake muſt be left. By how much the greater affliction any one is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in, ſo muc the greater grace he hath, and is dearer unto God. If any one could lay open my inſide, he would
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:137210:73"/>ſee there nothing but death. I have no prop, nor comfort, nor reſt neither in Heaven, nor in Earth, except the will of God, in which I lye down. God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins ſome new thing with me. I never was at this rate in ſufferings as I now am. I have nothing but the will of God, in which I acquieſce. And though I am preſſed with ſo hard afflictions, yet am I far beneath the paſſion of Chriſt, the ſon of God, whoſe hard and vehement paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, cannot be compared with, by any other. God upholdeth me above my own ſtrength: for it were impoſſible elſe for me to do or ſuffer that which I do. We aim at great things, but the cup we muſt firſt drink, before thoſe great things can come, is a bitter cup.</p>

                        <p>IT is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God who ſheweth mercy: This a man muſt experience with <hi>Paul</hi> in the higheſt ſtreight and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, before theſe words can be ſpoken by him: This is propoſed to a man; that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:137210:73"/>that very thing which thou loveſt, thou muſt forſake. What it is to be naked and forlorn, no man knoweth but he who feels it, and he who either was or is in ſuch a ſtate. I fall down before God like a moſt miſerable worm, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to lift my eyes up unto him. O the cup that is to be drunk! O the draught that conſumeth all things! he will not put out the ſmoaking flax, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhall conſume with fire. Here I lie like a dumb thing, or like to a poſt, and I only ſuffer miſery and affliction. I lye under the will of God, and corrupt. If it be ſaid: This is not in vain, for fruit will follow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I leave that to God, and only ſuffer his will. In God there is no ſuffering, if I could ſtand wholly in God there would be no need, that I ſhould ſuffer. God keeps me in the ſnares of death, and cauſeth me in time to go into the nothingneſs of my ſelf. Though one may get up many degrees, yet we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to deſcend, deſcend, deſcend, until we come into duſt and aſhes. That which before now we talked concerning this Nothingneſs it was with a certain
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:137210:74"/>kind of pleaſure, yet even all that muſt be ſubjected under its judgment: We cannot arrive at this nothingneſs, but by the exerciſe of God.</p>
                        <p>To be delighted with a righteous man, or his writings, words, or works, and to have a kindneſs and a good will for them, it is the gift of God.</p>

Many ſuppoſe themſelves to be that, which temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or trial diſcovers to them that they are not. We muſt eat as neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth: but we muſt eat, drink, and ſleep with fear: all propriety muſt expect its judgment, God ſuffers no appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That which is commonly ſaid, we can do nothing without God, is eaſily ſaid, but what that is in the very thing it ſelf, or what it is to be converſant in that very thing, no man knows, but he who is come thereunto. Where God
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:137210:74"/>teacheth and governeth, there is no place for reaſon, but it is ſet aſide. The teaching, leading, and rule of God doth far ſurpaſs it, and the matter ſeems, to it, to be impoſſible. Divinity is learnt with joy, but experienced with ſorrow. They which ſtudy divinity, are for the moſt part enemies to thoſe who experience it. If grief invadeth us, it is not to be oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leſt its fruits periſh, but we are to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in it, and yet not to deſpair.</p>

                        <p>TO have a nature wholly ſelf-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both as to God and to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is a deadly thing. Unleſs Nature ſhould be equally denied, as to God, as alſo to the creatures, it would not go into death. When the root is extripated, death is preſent: When that is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, the renounciation is eternal. When God hath once renounced nature, then is the end come; for it can never return back again to its former ſtate, but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in ſelf-denial even as to God alſo, for fleſh and blood poſſeſs not the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

When any one ſtill ſtands in labouring under the Law, in continency; then, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row may that be committed, which is to day omitted: Becauſe the root and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ſin, hath not yet been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, even to the very death. He that abides in a choice of things, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in affliction. He who alwayes ſeeks after better things and is not contented with the preſent, muſt neceſſarily be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes very thoughtful and reſtleſs. He is one who ſaith: When I thus ſtood in the appetite of things, my appetite did enlarge it ſelf ſo vaſtly, and towards ſo many varieties of things, that I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be at quiet, till I had wholly renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all deſire, and denying my own ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I came to be contented with a few ſmall things: and when I ſaw I could be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by the meaner ſort of things, I did not chooſe the better, nor was I afflicted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſollicitous about other things: Then at length, when I had found reſt, I was contented, which way ſoever things fell.</p>
                        <p>That which agreeth with Nature is
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:137210:75"/>chiefly to be omitted, and that which is moſt diſagreeing thereunto, that is, to be done: with how great a difficulty theſe things are done, may be perceived.

                        <p>WHen a man hath any thing in his proper poſſeſſion rightly, he thinks it is due unto him, and judgeth it unjuſt, if it be taken from him, till he is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. But then at length he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he cannot ſtand before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere judgment of God, and pronounceth God to be juſt in threatning to him in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:137210:77"/>judgment, death and deſtruction. Then he knows, that he is not worthy to live, and cleerly ſeeth, that none of them are due to him, which he had appropriated to himſelf, either as to God, or as to the creature, and therefore he can deſire no more, but ſuffereth his death with the deepeſt miſery and coaction. He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced concerning his appropriation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which he poſſeſſed all, and endeavoured to poſſeſs all unjuſtly, juſt as when one is convinced by ſealed deeds and writings, that this or the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance is not due to him, though he long kept them in his poſſeſſion for his own, but now is deſervedly commanded to give them up. The natural man is never made perfect, but is only tranſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Perfection is the man, Chriſt Jeſus: and as much as is received from him, that in him is perfect, holy, new, and juſt: yet it is not ſo in ſelf, for he muſt renounce ſelf, whoſe natural part is evil and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and muſt be made his, from whom it may become juſt, good, and holy: and that is brought to paſs in Chriſt, who is all theſe, nor is there any other name given, in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:137210:77"/>which theſe things can happen unto us.</p>
                        <p>If any ſong, writing, or words are accepted of a Chriſtian, and are grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his heart, it is neceſſary that it ſhould be expreſſed from out of the croſs, and from anguiſh. If it ſprings from joy, or from ſpeculation, it is vain, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſpirit or life. Experience teacheth all things, and that which is void of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is in vain.</p>
                        <p>We paſs thorough time into eternity, and time is mutable: ſo alſo is Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced with mutability, till he comes thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where there is no corruption nor mutation.</p>
                        <p>No man is to be rejected, with how groſs or how low a zeal his ſpirit boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with, becauſe they may be changed, and therefore we are to be quiet with a man that ſtandeth in his own zeal. We are firſt in time before we come into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.

                        <p>A man made conformable by letters, rules, ceremonies, or as to outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, is like a body which hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a noſe, a mouth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but yet it wanteth life.</p>
                        <p>Every thing by its contrary, is made of greater eſteem, accounted for holy, and is not rightly known, its contrary not being known, then it is not ſo. For if cold were not, heat would not be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for. Heaven is more clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by hell, and the grace of God, by his wrath or anger.</p>
                        <p>He that rightly knows the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and underſtands his reſtauration cannot rejoyce, becauſe a man muſt periſh for its ſake, and as to all theſe things he muſt be annihilated, as to what he is made for.

When the paſſion and death of Chriſt are really in a man, alſo his reſurrection is really in him: if one is real, ſuch alſo is the other, if the one be only notional, ſo alſo is the other; for there are divers reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                        <p>A man given up to, God, belongs to God, and he hath no propriety, but is a ſtranger to himſelf: whatever therefore God, or the creatures ſhall do unto him, he ought not to intangle himſelf with them, becauſe they are all of God, whoſe he is.</p>
                        <p>When one runneth ſo long, that for want of breath he lies down, then he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſeth whatever is his own, and ſo at length room is made for faith: To ſtand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in faith, is a moſt miſerable thing: for then is man's eſtate quite conſumed, ſo that he lives upon the ſavour of another, from whom he expecteth that, which he wanteth. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>If ye live according to the fleſh ye ſhall dye:</hi> They who are in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:137210:84"/>death, if they would draw life from elſe where, yet have they no time for to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, becauſe judgment is forthwith rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at hand, and the ſword ſlayeth them. But others, who are yet accuſed, are not yet in death. A Malefactor, who hath already ſuffered puniſhment, and is dead, is no longer accuſed; for juſtice hath paſſ'd upon him, and now, becauſe of that, he is juſtified, from whence was his accuſation. God freeth a man, but not ſo as to take him from the croſs, but to leave him there. God reconcileth a man's enemies to him, ſo as that he pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently endured them, as ſent unto him from the hand of God. Before acquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, a man is unbridled, but in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence he beholdeth the will of God, and there finds reſt.</p>
                        <p>Nothing is ſo ſtrong and powerful in a man, that God is not above it, and which he cannot overcome, and drive out, and ſo ſet the man at liberty.

                        <p>THe torments of the Martyrs are the glory of the death and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, for theſe have demonſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a man is to be led in a certain way above Nature thorough the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, which way is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to Nature. We muſt then die to all humane ſtrength, that the virtue of Chriſt may operate all theſe thing. Whence it is that they are called the lights of mankind, becauſe they are led above all the ſtrength, underſtanding, and will of men. And all theſe things can the virtue of the life, death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt perform, if it be not without a man, but really cometh into him. Where there is a real death and corruption, there alſo ſucceedeth a real life and ſalvation: but where that is not really done, but notionally only, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains without a man, there alſo life and ſalvation is not real but notional only, and without a man. The Martyrs in their torments gave glory unto God. Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:137210:86"/>is not given to God before that a man arriveth at, or cometh unto his death, and is eſtranged from himſelf, and God doth take up his room or place, who keepeth, governeth, leadeth, and exerciſeth him above all reaſon; which reaſon here, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſees nor knows any door of eſcape, but is held captive under the obedience of faith: becauſe a thick cloud and a dark miſt hath covered the eyes thereof, that it cannot ſee the way whereby God is wont to lead a man. This is here that paſſive ſtate, when a man dyeth, and ſuffers God. But in the active ſtate, under the Law, when life ſtill is preſent, it was not ſo, for then a man was governed by reaſon, to whom was added Will and Knowledge about the actions, and omiſſions of a man: though all things are directed by divine help, and in divine claritude, which ſtruck reaſon down, ſo that a man could go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern himſelf, conduct, and conſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, day and night, yet when all theſe are taken away, he muſt at length come into death, that God may come and take his place, and adminiſter all things himſelf. Then a man is drawn ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:137210:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>way, then what he walked before, and it is that which excels his own will, knowledge, and ſtrength. This man is become paſſive and God operateth in him. As the conſcience and the mind was captivated, and ſadened, when it was well with the fleſh, ſo when the fleſh came into death, the mind and conſcience was exhilerated, and ſet at liberty.</p>
                        <p>Many and great gifts of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit do come really into a man, which yet are not Regeneration; But they go and come. Whereas that is Regeneration, when &amp; where God hath planted his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, and God is become one with man. In God, neither the world, not pleaſure, nor joy is ſuffered, Nature muſt want all theſe when the mind ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in God.</p>
                        <p>They who ſtand under grace, their outward man is always conſerved or kept by a deadly judgment, their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man by vital nouriſhment: thus they are always kept by God.</p>
                        <p>Into the mind, which ſtandeth in God, no motion to joy or grief can penetrate: But there comes a great ſorrow, which
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:137210:87"/>deſcends into the fleſh, that the mind may remain free.</p>
                        <p>What is patience, is it or not, when a man ſuffers and complains to no man? no, no, for this is only continence, but not real patience. But this is patience, when a man can imprecate no evil upon another, by reaſon of any adverſity: but if any one hath injured him, he prayeth hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily for him; note, he hath a kindneſs, for him, and loveth him: and if one hath taken any thing from him, he yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up, and giveth all theſe things to him as unto his own ſelf, and is (upon it) of a chearful, and not of a ſad mind. And this is the fruits of the ſpirit: but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is the work of the Law, and cannot juſtify a man in the ſight of God, and is precedent unto righteouſneſs, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows afterwards through faith, in which all things are real, which were before notional: for in old things did abide the ſhaddow, but the real things are of Chriſt him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>elf: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>The Law could make nothing perfect,</hi> but was the bringing in of a better hope. There was no reſt to the Fathers till Chriſt did come, as the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:137210:88"/>Prophet ſaith concerning Sion, <hi>Iſaiab</hi> 62.1. That if one would be made one with the truth, it cannot be done, whilſt non-corruption laſteth: and whatſoever is ſaid or underſtood, of it whilſt it laſteth is without experience. Non-corruption hopeth in vain, for it cometh or arriveth not unto God. For no man receiveth God without death and deſtruction. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very natural man is in the deſire of God, or the creature, and yet neither is due unto him: for if he could come at God, as he does to the creatures, he would alike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe him, as he abuſeth them, <hi>viz.</hi> with appropriation. Theſe may be thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; every imagination, which is in man concerning God or the truth, before purgation or death, nature is ready to appropriate it to her ſelf, and to reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented therein with delight: that ſhe may upon that account receive honour, and reſpect, and, notwithſtanding, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is ſtill but according to the fleſh, which is followed by death. For this riſing up cannot abide, this bridegroom muſt be taken away, before the real truth can appear. The Apoſtles poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:137210:88"/>Chriſt before his death imaginarily, but after death really. Whence <hi>Paul</hi> writeth: That he knew Chriſt no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit and the truth; and that he walked according to that ſpirit, and not according to the fleſh, and that they were now become inviſible to evey natural man, whence they can be judged by none, but are able to judge all: that they were now ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed or made holy, by the Holy Spirit, after that Chriſt was riſen again from the death; before whoſe death and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection no man could be holy.</p>
                        <p>The Holy Spirit maketh holy, as the Lord ſaith: <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs I go away, the Holy Spirit the Advocate, will come unto you. And no man putteth new wine into old bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi> &amp;c. To renounce all creatures, that nothing may remain but God, and to ſet God only for the end and aim, Nature and Fleſh do hear it with terrour, for they are amazed at this, when they hear, that all things muſt be taken away from them. So that if the fleſh can but retain one only thing, though the vileſt, yet would it put or place its whole life therein, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:137210:89"/>would adhere thereunto: But in truth it cannot be ſo well done for it, for all things will renounce it which way ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it tendeth. Whence at length it muſt without any ſupport let it ſelf down into death and plainly dye to all things.</p>
                        <p>When a King and a Beggar are ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death the death of either, is the ſame and alike? but yet with a diſtinction.</p>
                        <p>He that is in corruption, beholding other good men ſtill ſtanding in non-cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, thinketh thus: Alas! in what condition are you! O how much ſtill can you be ſatiated and exhilerated with God, when I can neither be ſo, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it.</p>
                        <p>To be at reſt no where, but in God, it's requiſite, before all things, that one ſhould become poor. The ſufferings of <hi>Job</hi> are not hid from me, but that which followed after it, cannot make me glad. The Lord ſaith: <hi>What will it profit a man to gain the whole World, and to loſe his own Soul?</hi> and what advantage would it be to a man to know all things, and yet he experienceth them not, nor are they fulfilled in him! and therefore we
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:137210:89"/>ought not to take care of that, to know or underſtand much, but that we may ſenſibly apprehend and experience much. <hi>Knowledge puffeth up, but Charity edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,</hi> faith the Apoſtle: Experience ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth all things in man, and is adequate to knowledge: And thus alſo the man is made humble.</p>

                        <p>WHen death is known, it is alſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And by how much the more profoundly death is known, by ſo much the more doth it terrify, and is it feared. If Death muſt, be true, it muſt be true as to all things. When Nature is once dead, as to corporal things, it ought to remain dead, and, as to them, never to revive again: But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then life aſcends in the Soul, and there ſeeks nouriſhment: But Death follows it thither alſo; and cuts off the thred of that life alſo, that it may there alſo remain always dead, nor can it ever revive again. So that at laſt, the life aſcendeth above all creatures, yea above the Angels alſo; by how many
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:137210:90"/>degrees it is to aſcend into life, by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deaths it is to dye, and always to abide in death. If one abſtaineth from any thing, he may take it up again: but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what any one is dead unto, that, ought always to remain dead, ſo as that it can never be re-aſumed. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver poſſeſs piety, and whatſoever I receive from God by my piety, I am plainly robbed thereof, and I can boaſt no where, neither before God, nor before any man, nor before my own ſelf: for I live by free-grace alone: This ſtate is ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that no man knoweth it, but he that is touched therewith. And though I muſt live by free-grace yet I know of no grace, nor can I comprehend, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, nor know, nor find where that grace ſhould be, nor whence it ſhould come, although I have often felt it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought this grace to be both given and taken above and beyond the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, knowledge, and comprehenſion of all men, yea above all merit or godlineſs, that is in a man, as alſo above all intellect, and illumination: but as for the juſtice of God, judgment, hell, and damnation,

But the will of God is my chiefeſt Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: As long as the will of God overſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows me, I can bear all, though I ſhould be roaſted, or boyled, annihilated, or ſlain in Body, Soul, and Spirit. But when the will of God hideth it ſelf for ſome time, that I do not feel it over me, I fall into ſuch ſtreights, as an unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced perſon cannot believe. My whole hope is, that the Lord will lead us all thorough all, though the caſe be full of ſorrows, for his arm is all powerful.</p>

                        <p>THe Will of God is the death of the Fleſh. Faith, when it is upon trial, God then proving it, it experienceth the greateſt miſery. There are many waies of coming unto regeneration, but the end of all is one and the ſame, yet one aſcendeth in ſome much higher then another doth: as when any one cometh into the Sun-ſhine, he hath the Sun, yet is one nearer to the Sun than another.</p>
                        <p>This is my counſel, that a time be ſet to attain unto God. The inward mind is free, but the outward humanity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace, is exerciſed under a ſevere judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I have no prop under me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I reſpect God or the creatures, or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or the Earth: and I have nothing, but that I can lay my ſelf down in the Divine Will, being wholly ſet down under God. The Kingdom of Heaven is preſent, but I cannot enjoy it: the Sun indeed hath ſhined, but now the falling thereof is come, and it ſhineth no longer. I lie down in darkneſs, and in the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:137210:91"/>of Death, nor is there any comfort left to me but in the will of God: for I will nothing, but only what he willeth. Into which ſtate if any one really cometh, he is of all men the moſt miſerable. I ſay this, that I may expreſs that miſery in which I lie. To underſtand theſe things is pleaſant but really to feel them, moſt bitter.</p>
                        <p>When the Spirit ſuffers, the fleſh ought to ſuffer with it: But when the fleſh ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers there is no need, for the Spirit to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. It is never better with me then when I give up my ſelf into death.</p>
                        <p>The fleſh ſuffereth its own judgment, when the Spirit is in peace, but when the Spirit ſuffers, the fleſh muſt ſuffer alſo. The poor animals muſt dye, for my ſake, though againſt my will: But becauſe I alſo give my ſelf up to death, I do not refuſe the death alſo of the animals; he that giveth not himſelf up into death, cannot take his food with thankſgiving.</p>
                        <p>He that is to exerciſe modeſty, he ought to be exerciſed by various afflictions, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                           </gap>herwiſe he will wander, if he ſhall uſe it without the experience of the croſs. If I
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:137210:92"/>ſhould ſtand betwixt two things, nor knew which of the two I am to do, I would weigh them, and would take that which is contrary to my fleſh. When I do ſo, it is well with me, and I call God to witneſs, ſaying: Thou knoweſt, O Lord, what I have done. But when I do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is grateful unto Nature, it is always ill with me, and I cannot call God to witneſs. Conſcience indeed is free, but I dare not alleadge that, for it is of grace.</p>
                        <p>The ſuffering is hard, when no hope is left in the future for the natural man: for though the day-break is come, yet there is no redemption, nor comfort, but a man muſt wait without hope, and be quiet in death. And though all the joy, comfort and refreſhment of the whole world were preſent, yet he is bound as it were with cords, and can taſt of none of them. And therefore he never deſires that time may run out, that a day, a week, a month, a year may come, for whatever cometh to paſs in them, is to him as it were a non-entity, becauſe he can reſt no where, nor uſe any thing for
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:137210:92"/>his delight, for he is made bare or naked of all, and is put upon the croſt. Hence is it that both things preſent, and to come are indifferent to him, when even then he ſhall be the ſame as he is now. But thoſe to whom the body of ſin is not yet crucified, they are touched with the deſire of time. For they are free, and can take up ſuch things as they meet with: But this ſtate cannot laſt long, for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will come: then whatever ſhall be with him for the furture, he cannot take it up, and that which is contrary to him he cannot reject: for he is impotent, whilſt he hangeth on the croſs, nor can he execute his own will.</p>

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:137210:93"/>in God, in which one is free from himſelf, for to be free from ones ſelf, is a liberty, which is to be attributed to God.</p>
                        <p>The groſſeſt and the loweſt things are images of things ſuperiour, which is to be underſtood as well of things ſpiritual, as things corporeal, for we aſcend from the one into the other, and from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the ſuperiour, even as pleaſures, and the abuſe of good things and the building on the ſands are images. When things are moſt groſs and low, then are they the image of things ſuperiour, and that which is viſible denoteth that that is inviſible. The Spirit alſo hath its fleſh in which it dwells. Alſo myſteries have their external Hiſtories. They who urge myſteries ſo, as to exclude hiſtorys, diſturb order and do err. Although Chriſt the bleſſed fulfils all things, in ſpirit, in his elect, which he performed coporally in the days of his fleſh, yet were they alſo corporally done in him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the hiſtorical ſenſe muſt remain, but alſo it behooveth a man to experience in his own ſelf the myſtery likewiſe.</p>

                        <p>The natural man is ſurrounded with death, and which way ſoever he turns himſelf, he hath a ſword preſented to his ſight: juſt as when one turns on this, and on that ſide ſhould look about him, and ſtill ſome body runs before his face: ſo alſo is judgment always meeting with the natural man, ready to ſnatch away his life, which way ſoever he turns himſelf. At laſt he yields up himſelf, when he can no more make his eſcape. But the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is in life; when the body (or nature) hangs ſtretched out upon the Croſs. Zeal in kindled with divine pleaſure, is a great pleaſure, but the Croſs and violent plagues follow after it. Myrrh was the laſt gift. For it is written; They offered Gold, Franckincenſe and Myrrh. When I hear the Scripture, I am frighted, for it denoteth the natural death. Nature will have an appropriation, therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is a death to it at which it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted.</p>

                        <p>TO deſiſt from propriety, and to help another at our own loſs, is a thing truly pleaſant. To find gain in loſs, and to abſtain from that which is beſt in our eſteem, and to prefer another thereunto, is a thing grateful to the mind. It would be truly a juſt thing, if he who hath the temporal goods, ſhould ſo relieve his neighbour in want, that the one ſhould be made equal with the other, nor ſhould the advantage, or means of the one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the other: if any one is not yet arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at or come up to this account, he ought to eſteem it for thing unjuſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought alſo to be ſorrowful for it, as alſo to endeavour to bring it to that paſs.</p>
                        <p>Let no man judge another in any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs whatſoever, eſpecially in that which he himſelf hath not yet experienced, and in which he hath not yet got the victory: for if he himſelf ſhould fall into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who knows, how he would behave himſelf in it. If any one therefore will
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:137210:94"/>uſe modeſty, he muſt hold his tongue upon the fall of others in temptation, and behold them with commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For if any one himſelf hath been in temptation, and hath overcome, ſo that he remains conſtant in that victory, in the which he ſees another to ſtumble and fail, without all doubt he was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo afflicted with ſuch ſtreights, that he cannot poſſibly do otherwiſe but pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty his neighbour thus overcome, although he do not defend his falling: ſeeing the caſe it ſelf is in it ſelf, ſo deplorable, that he needs not add to its load, from his judgings: This man therefore ſtands thus, and beholds all men with an eye of pity or commiſeration, and neither judgeth, nor reproacheth them, for he knoweth that God alone is the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to him, whereby it is, that he alſo does not run headlong in the way of theſe men, till he becomes equal and alike to them; and that he ſhould eaſily be like unto them, if God ſhould deſert him, or not lead him in ſo wonderful a manner as he doth, and ſupport him with ſo much long-ſuffering. Theſe are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:137210:95"/>that ſuſpend his raſh judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: whence it is, that the deſtruction of others cannot make him glad, but he rather is ſad and ſorrowful for it, and knows, that he is not better then they, and therefore ranks himſelf in the ſame rank with them, yea puts himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them. And whatever is found to be better in himſelf that comes not but from out of the mercy of God, and not out of his own worth and ſtrength.</p>

Alſo whoever reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or fleeth from any croſs, or adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cannot come to the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf: and where there is not a knowledge of ones ſelf, there can be no crying to God. He that will come to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:137210:95"/>the true peace of God, he ought firſt to be exerciſed with all diſquiet, eſpecially when God exerciſeth him by men who are difficult, croſs, and moroſe: For bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter means then theſe cannot be found to prepare him for that condition. For thoſe men, by whom God exerciſeth good men, do apply all their diligence to ſpy out and obſerve in their neighbour ſomewhat that is reprehenſible, though it be never ſo little, and that they expoſe maliciouſly enough, eſpecially if other good men may hear or ſee it. And then it is, that it behooveth him, that is thus exerciſed, to hold his tongue, and not to defend himſelf: and though he may ſpy out many and greivous ſpots on his adverſary, yet is he not to look at them, but only at his own ſpots, and in his heart to confeſs himſelf guilty of them. But when he doth not thus, but turneth his eyes on him, who accuſeth him, he will yet more egregiouſly err: but ſo ſoon as ever he does obſerve it; he ought preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to turn away himſelf, and to take the matter as immediatly from the hand of God. For as long as a man is not yet
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:137210:96"/>freed, he ſtill wandreth oftentimes in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, though unwillingly. From and by afflicting, and moroſe men if we uſe them rightly for that end, for which they are given unto us of God, we may be much more advanced forward, then from and by men of great perfections, whilſt we are ſtill under ſin.</p>
                        <p>As long as a man is in the ſtate of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> ſo long he muſt labour, but when he ſhall come to the ſtate of <hi>Mary,</hi> he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth no more: in the ſtate of <hi>Mary</hi> a man is only under God; and Chriſt floweth down from above into a man like a river or ſtream.</p>
                        <p>A man tranſplanted by God, is, in his own eyes, the moſt uncertain of all men living: for he ought not to promiſe to himſelf the leaſt part of life, ſo as that he can live one moment of time: ſo uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he is, that when he goes to bed, he knows not, whither he ſhall riſe again, as if his life were to be taken from him, that very moment. If any other world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man ſhould behold the inſide of this man he would be altogether aſtoniſhed: yea the man, who ſeeketh God, and is
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:137210:96"/>not yet purified, could not abide thus, no not one hour only: for as a thing it ſelf, and its image have a likeneſs externally, but inwardly do vaſtly differ, ſo is the caſe here. Juſt as if two men ſhould ſtand together, and ſhould give alms all the day long, and one of them ſhould wiſh, that the buſineſs would quickly be at an end, becauſe he doth it with a grutching heart: but the other ſhould wiſh, that he might be always giving, yea he would give his whole ſelf too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he does it with a glad and a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling heart. Now when a man is ſenſible in himſelf of his churliſh temper with contrition, and is therefore ſorry, and wiſheth, that he could do it with a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind, then the Lord will further help him, and will purge his floor. But they who are contented thus with an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſhow, and thereupon think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves righteous, all is not right with them.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the young beginner, this ſimilitude is to be obſerved: An infant who cannot yet go alone would alwayes have ſomewhat whereby he might hold

The ways of the wicked are the creatures, which are corruptible; whence it is alſo that their way periſheth. For all the actions, buſineſs, and pleaſure of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:137210:98"/>the unrighteous at laſt ſinks and falls into nothing.</p>
                        <p>O Father, this is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent: This is holineſs, and God, above all images: and of this, nature, or the natural man, partaketh nothing, but remaineth ſeparated from God, and all his creatures: Alas, how great an affliction is this to Nature, to want images, when as the natural man cannot get above images: for all his joy, quiet, peace, advantage conſiſt in, and together with images: if therefore God alone is preſent, his death is preſent. God alone is eſſence and being it ſelf, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the natural man cannot come, or elſe he could never fall, for whatſoever cometh into God is eternal and unmov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <p>All that are ſaid of the fall, are ſaid of the natural man, whilſt he yet abideth in images, and appearances, and that ſtate is to be conſumed-with its deſire of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, and of increaſing, before the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence it ſelf is come: but when this is come, Nature muſt be ſubjected unto
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:137210:98"/>death, and not have any life or joy in that eſſence; for that priviledge is not due unto Nature. And here it is that God filleth the place of man, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, honoureth, and praiſeth his own ſelf, and he worketh, and ſetteth up what he pleaſeth: and here God himſelf is preſent, and therefore the glory belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to God, and not to man. Here man ſtands naked in his poverty, and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates nothing to himſelf, becauſe to God alone the glory is due. When the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a thing is preſent, all images vaniſh: and becauſe the Natural man medleth with nothing but images, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is robbed of theſe, when the thing it ſelf is come, and then he lieth in death: yet his mind is taken up into the thing, that is, into life: but the fleſh, or nature goes into death, nor draws any life, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from God, or from the creature. The natural labour of a man is this, to yield up one thing, that ſo he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a better, and to go out of one chamber or room, that ſo he may come into another more fair: And when he hath gotten all theſe things, for whoſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:137210:99"/>ſake he left the former, at laſt he is alſo caſt out of them, and hath nothing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here, or there, being deſerted on both hands, and brought to want in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther room: Yet ſo long as he ſees any eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape ſo long he laboureth, until this alſo faileth: Then he yields up himſelf, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in imitating the Ape, who defends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and labours, ſo long as he ſees a way to evade, but being hindred of that he lyes down, and ſuffers himſelf to be beaten and knock'd, yea he admitteth all, though it be ſtill againſt his will: So alſo the natural man ſuffers not theſe things willingly, but quite againſt his will.</p>

                        <p>TO do nothing (in obedience to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience under the Law) but only to lye down, and ſuffer God's work, is a great affliction: Then we cry, Oh that I could do ſomething. But action hath been before already, and it was done with delight and willingly. But when we muſt want, as well the worſer, as the better alſo, and lie down in death
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:137210:99"/>without hope of riſing again, or of revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, this at laſt proves a wonderful ſtreight. Nature had had before the knowldge of the gain, and therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was ſweet and pleaſant to it: but here ſhe ſuffereth under action, and knows no gain from it, therefore theſe things are bitter and ſharp unto her, and are done againſt her will.</p>
                        <p>The knowledge of a natural man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in images. But God knoweth himſelf without image or notion. The creatures, wherewith brutes are fed, are made more noble in man, &amp; man is made more noble in God. And ſo the creatures in ſuch a man return again into God. And as the Creatures without cutting ſerve not for the uſe of Man, ſo neither without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, are they united to him, ſo alſo cannot Man be united to God without corruption, for all things are done in order.</p>
                        <p>Holineſs is a worthy thing and unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable, and the natural man participat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing thereof, becauſe nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come thither. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>Other foundation can no man lay, but Chriſt.</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion cometh into a man in one monent,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:137210:100"/>and that moment is like to lightening but is not the thing it ſelf, for this follows after. When a man hath received that momentary lightening, his intellect is bound down under it. By one only ſhine, God doth more perfect the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and diſcretion of a man, then a man can do himſelf in twenty years, nor yet is the thing it ſelf preſent. Many there are that have that, and are dead, who yet never arrived at the thing it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>In a time of neceſſity all my friends for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook me, and when I came unto them, that they ſhould help me, they all went backwards from me. Theſe friends were thoſe Revelations, which I had, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I reſolved to truſt in them no more, for aſſiſting me in a caſe of Neceſſity.</p>
                        <p>He that would keep his ſenſes from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, he muſt endeavour to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in prayers, for there is help. And he that would keep his ſenſes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from inroads, he hath every day ſomething to do, for the caſe is with him as it is with a City beſieged. For no City can either by the Emperour, or by
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:137210:100"/>the Turk, be begirt with ſo greivous a ſiege, as this man is beſieged with.</p>
                        <p>In this affliction, God is merciful to the man, and loves him, but the man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it not, till at laſt he comes to feel it. God ſeems as if he were deaf, nor to be willing to know or to hear ſuch men, but at length it is found, that the intention of God was always good: for it is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards apprehended, that God is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in our miſerable ſtreights.</p>
                        <p>When a man makes the creatures his aim and end, he deceiveth himſelf. The creatures ought to ſerve us to attain to our aim, <hi>viz.</hi> God, but they themſelves ought not to be the ſcope: we ought to adhere to God, and not to the creatures, and to have a heavenly ſenſe of things, and not an earthly.</p>

                        <p>HE that ſtandeth in God, to him all that happens are accounted to be God: he can impute nothing to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for he hath nothing to do with

                        <p>NO man can have humility without affliction. <hi>Herod,</hi> the fiery dragon, and the mountain lifted up, would have killed the little infant, under the ſhew of devotion, or worſhip.

                        <p>I deſired and I ſought: but whatever I ſought and found, it now lies in death, and ſuffers deſtruction together with all that that was gain to me, and that too without all hope of recovery. For that which muſt riſe again, is not the body which is ſown, <hi>for fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> and therefore muſt a man be ſlain, according to the Fleſh: for it's according to the Fleſh that a man dyes, and is made alive again
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:137210:102"/>according to the ſpirit. If a thing ſhould riſe again as it dyes, it would riſe again in nature, and would be natural: but it is not ſo done; <hi>Paul</hi> faith, <hi>It is ſowen a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body.</hi> Nature partaketh not of the Kingdom of God, hence it is, that the death thereof is without all hopes. The natural man hopeth to be the heir of the Kingdom, and thinks that the promiſes of God belong unto him, and applies all that is written to himſelf: but then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the thing comes to be otherwiſe apprehended when one is lead whither he would not, and God is glorified in and by his death. There nature is renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it muſt be robbed of all ſalvation and be denyed. That which the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man applied to himſelf, another tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. They, that went out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to come into the promiſed Land, and did divide it out to themſelves, but they abode in the wilderneſs and dyed there, and their poſterity only entred into <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine.</hi> Whatſoever therefore the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man underſtands, or ſayes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things, yet all this is againſt him,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:137210:102"/>for it ſpeaks of a ſword, which is to kill him. Now they which are in this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and ſpeak any thing thereof, they ſpeak it with affliction, and not with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, nor can they ask for more then formerly, becauſe it belongs not unto them, ſeeing all things tend to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and death: and into death a man is unwillingly dragged: he conveighs not himſelf thither, for if it ſtood at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he would never chooſe this ſtate or condition: but he is catched and put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into by another, who is above him, and ſtronger then himſelf. Juſt as it is now with the death of the body, ſo the matter is alſo carried in this other death, of which it is ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> When any one thinks he hath found his Soul, and that he is confirmed in life, yet muſt he be ſubjected unto death. Now the Lord ſuffers him firſt to grow, and to increaſe, and grow ripe in youth: but when he is accompliſhed in that youth, he plainly careth not for death, and though he knows, that a time of dying muſt come, yet lie laies it not cloſe to heart, till he be grown old, then death frights him, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:137210:103"/>ſtands before his eyes, and yet neither then does he know how much miſery there is there to be met with, for if he knew it, he would dye aforehand for mere grief. They who depart from earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, according to the teſtimony of conſcience, that they may ſeek the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Souls, and to arrive at true ripeneſs of youth, rejoyce in this death, when they hear of it, and underſtand it becauſe of the fruit that ſprings from thence: But they, who are in this death, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of that joy: for if they could yet have any joy, they would ſtill have life, and conſequently could not be in death: becauſe what ever dyes, is ſeparated from all life. Poſterity only lives and rejoyces. Nothing is due to corruption, but death and deſtruction, and in death all things are removed, as faith, and truſt, and hope, and charity, and all joy, and every thing that is founds, is to be forſaken. Now if it be to be forſaken and loſt, it muſt firſt be found out, and taken up: for that which one hath not, he cannot give up: Now that which here is thus to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken, is alſo deſtitute of hope, as was

Labour at firſt was ſweet, becauſe gain ſprung there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, <hi>viz.</hi> that the life or ſoul might be found, which alſo was found. But when this life is found, it is loſt again in that ſame dying, and a man is alienated from himſelf, and God poſſeſſeth the place of ſelf, and there is no more mountain or valley, but God alone: for Nature is quite ſhut out.</p>

                        <p>IF ſin were not, neither would death be: if death were not, neither would there be a reſurrection, therefore all things work together for good, for the elect. Now that which firſt departed from

And thus he proceedeth from ſtate to ſtate, from a lower to a higher, from a pure one, to one more pure.

And therefore he can never be reſtored more, nor be made glad by any means, becauſe the joy is reſerved for him that abides after death, as the Prophet faith: Theſe ſhall be written for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to come, and the people which ſhall be created, ſhall praiſe the Lord.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:137210:105"/>compelled to follow order, and ſo he acted rightly, and had not done rightly, unleſs he had done ſo; becauſe he would have been diſobedient to God, (who is a God of order, and leadeth a man in order) whence eternal death, that ſevere judgment of God would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.

                        <p>And therefore we muſt firſt endeavour to yield ready obedience, and always to attend to that which is next: and alſo from the very firſt beginning, the croſs will not be wanting, and by the way thereof, we ſhall go. By what a man departeth from earthly things, in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his conſcience, by that is he, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>length, rightly prepared to come into the earth, that is, into the corruption of himſelf: and that which grows out of this, ſtandeth before God. This corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the natural man ought to laſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the corporal death of a man, and after that the tender twig at laſt ſpringeth
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:137210:105"/>forth. But the mind here, even yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the corporal death, cometh into the reſurrection, and is made a ſon of grace, and of the covenant, which conſiſteth in the blood of Chriſt, now poured forth for the remiſſion of ſins. Chriſt waſheth us from ſin, by his blood, which ſpeaketh better things, then the blood of <hi>Abel:</hi> without the effuſion of the blood of Chriſt, there is accompliſhed no remiſſion of ſins, or purification. It is a Moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing to be freed and purged from ſins: but to feel how that redemption is performed, and to experience that miſery, is no pleaſant matter, but exceeding ſharp and difficult: Nor is it poſſible for a man, ſo much as to behold the thing, much leſs to execute and perform it. But it is God alone who both beginneth and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth it, to whom nothing is deficient, becauſe his works are all perfect: Now here a man does nothing elſe, but give himſelf up into tranquility, and ſuffer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:137210:106"/>man needs to ſay, that the thing is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: becauſe the work and purpoſe of God goeth forwards. Here alſo do faith and patience take place, which alſo are the work of God, and not ours. When one ſerveth the Law of God in the mind, then in the fleſh, he ſerveth the Law of ſin. By how much the more of the ſins of concupiſcence and appetite, remaineth in the fleſh, by ſo much the more miſery, affliction, and death, the man hath: for he walketh not according to the fleſh, as being that which condemned under the Law, and being hurried away violently by ſin, is crucified by the Law of ſin. Now where theſe things are not, there a man ſtill walketh according to the fleſh: and by how much, the more there is at that time, of the ſins of concupiſcence, and of appetites in the fleſh, ſo much the more of life and joy a man hath: but alas! it is a miſerable life, which is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by eternal death.</p>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:137210:107"/>For without outward affliction, nature ſearches out many eſcapes, that inward affliction cannot touch her. As if one kept in a dungeon, ſhould ſtill ſee light by one only cranny, and upon that account, the evils of being in a dungeon would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come much eaſier to him: So alſo as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can catch its propriety, this internal affliction is hindered, nor can gain a room or place. For there is no place for inward ſufferings, where Nature hath got eſcaping holes. Great is the miſery where nature is thus kept in death, that ſhe can hope for nothing: but acquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence can bear all things.</p>
                        <p>He who is founded in death, deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and miſery and is quiet in them, admits not comfort either of life or of joy, and is unmoved as to all things, which are grateful and acceptable, and no man can either comfort him, or terrify him. For if one ſhould threaten ſpoiling, death, miſery, and affliction to him, he already forſeeth all theſe, and yieldeth himſelf up unto them, and is converſant in them. And therefore he is immoveable, both in reſpect of things grateful, or of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful:
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:137210:107"/>No man can either make him merry, or fright him. Death, and the withdrawing of all things, are indeed a terrour to him, but not ſuch a one as now at length beginneth but now afflicteth him. Nor do grateful things exhilerate him, becauſe he hath renounced all things, and he can re-aſume nothing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is unmoved. Here Nature is, as it were, ground between two Mill ſtones, becauſe he acknowledges the judgment of God upon him to be juſt, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch miſery, that he muſt thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the thing; and the thing muſt then be done. But he is not like other male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, who are outwardly in affliction and captivity: For theſe if they could kill their keeper, they would readily do it, that they might get looſe, yea if they could, break the windows, gates and walls. But this other ſort do not thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves, but are ſubjected unto the will of God, and in it do quietly reſt: and although they could do as other do, yet that they cannot deſire: there is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a great difference betwxt the coacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe, and of theſe.</p>

                        <p>GOd himſelf is the uncreated Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſpreads it ſelf forth round about: juſt as the Sun is every where diſperſed abroad, where it can be received: But where it cannot be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the fault is not in it ſelf. If therefore this univerſal uncreated Salvation, which is God himſelf ought to take place in man, then muſt the proper, included, and created ſalvation of man periſh: for this is not God himſelf, and therefore it cannot ſtand in the ſight of God; and a man muſt, on that ſcore, be caſt into death, and deſtruction, and be depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his Soul, which he had with much labour ſaved: and when by his labour he was come ſo far, that he could not get fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then was it time for God not be at reſt but to caſt him into death: that ſo he might by grace eſtabliſh that in the man, which the man by the Law could not gain thorough much labour. For whatſoever Chriſt repreſented in life and doctrine, is impoſſible to be actively fulfilled, yet it muſt be fulfilled in death.</p>
                        <pb n="203" facs="tcp:137210:108"/>
                        <p>It behooveth a Man to dye, that God himſelf may effect the matter and that the glory thereof may not be Man's.</p>
                        <p>It is not labour, but Regeneration. Chriſt bringeth grace, and that which is grace, is not the labour of man: and (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a man, having paſſed his own proper created Salvation, comes unto the univerſal increated Salvation, which is God himſelf: and this Salvation, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God, and with this a man can ſtand, before God, for God can ſtand before himſelf. And this man no more judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any one. For this Sun hath nothing ſtrange in it, with this ſalvation a man hath communion without appropriation. And here it is, that the communion of Saints taketh place.</p>
                        <p>Life repulſed by one; flees to another in which it lives, till it ſelf alſo dyeth. When the life dyeth as to the creature, it is nothing eſteemed off in reſpect of that life which dyes as to it ſelf: for there life yet remains alive, and receiveth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and greater objects then it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and in them it then liveth, and hath only changed one for another, and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:137210:109"/>inſtead of a worſer, hath received a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor is it dead in it ſelf, but is ſtill the very ſame life: but when a life dyeth to its own ſelf, there is affliction unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, when it can have nothing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it can be ſuſtained, and which can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, or comfort it: for the deſtruction thereof is without hope, for when it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth can riſe up again no more: becauſe it falls a natural thing, and it riſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain a ſpiritual thing, and therefore like ſeeketh like, the old bottle cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain new wine: a new patch agreeth not with an old garment, therefore we muſt dye to deformity when conformity is to be performed.</p>
                        <p>It is very neceſſary to have diſcretion: but no man can have it, but he that hath the ſeven gifts of the Holy Spirit, of which the Prophet ſpeaketh, and the laſt of them is, The fear of the Lord; for when one receiveth the former gifts, then at laſt he is round about filled with the fear of the Lord, and the Lord is feared in all.</p>

                        <p>ABout the prophetical promiſes of God, we muſt always obſerve, whom they reſpect: for they belong not to the natural man, and he participat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing of them, but only his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                        <p>Whatever is extent in the Prophets, and the Apoſtles have wrot, is praiſed as that which is beautiful, yea and it is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful: but to the Natural man it is death and he participateth nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Although therefore he ſhall praiſe it as that which is beautiful, yet it is his death: yea and therefore he muſt come into death, if it muſt be applied unto him. But Chriſt is conſtituted by his father, to be the Saviour, that he may apply all that, and fulfil it by the croſs.</p>
                        <p>No man that is not dead cometh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace and the Goſpel: therefore they falſly boaſt, who glory that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace without death. A man not dead is firſt to be ſubdued by the Law, and therefore is to be prepared for death,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:137210:110"/>by means of which, he is freed from the Law, and comes under grace: as long as he is alive, he belongs to the ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law, but when he is, after that, dead, he is under grace, for Chriſt is not the ſervant of ſin, that he might leave our ſins in their own ſtate, but he came, that he might free us from ſin, which is done by the means of death. Sin is pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed with death. And Chriſt is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the natural man, that he ſhould remain alive. For if he ſhould do that, we ſhould come without death into God, which is impoſſible. Let every one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abſtain from falſe boaſtings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend no unrighteouſneſs, for that thing will never find ſucceſs. The whole world is full of falſe boaſtings concerning Chriſt, but we muſt not be conformed to the word, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith.</p>
                        <p>A man is ſecretly beſieged by many things, of which he is ignorant, and he then at laſt comes to apprehend it, when they are withdrawn from him. Alſo a man ſometimes apprehendeth a defect in: himſelf and is ignorant what it ſhould be which oftentimes is ſo great, that it muſt
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:137210:110"/>be qualified by the Lord. The miſery, defect and death of nature is rather to be born with, then to fly to complaints, anger, and murmurings. Suffer and hold thy tongue, and thou ſhalſt be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with help and aſſiſtance. Break not out into words, but repreſs their motion. Flee not from the affliction of thy Nature for come it from whence it will, it will bring with it great gain unto thee, and will be a benefactour to thy heart. If thou ſhalſt not do this, thou ſhalſt have a diſturbed mind, and ſhalſt hot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced forward by any exerciſe.</p>
                        <p>There are many things in which a man followeth concupiſcence, where yet he pretends to another fair outſide ſhow. Whatever is beyond neceſſity, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God, and to all righteouſneſs, yea and to a man's own ſelf. No man ought to boaſt of his exerciſe before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but to walk in the fight of God, and to reſt quiet in him. For its enough if God ſeeth it. All high-mindedneſs is to be avoided, leaſt we be eſteemed for ſome body before others. Exerciſe thy ſelf before God.</p>

                        <p>To be able to tolerate ignorance, is wiſdom. It is the part of grave old men to wink at the folly of youth.</p>
                        <p>When any one lies in death, and is filled therewith, and both inwardly and outwardly is without reſt both day and night, and ſeeth others full of life, there it is expreſſed, what lies hid in him, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life or death.

                        <p>THere is no need that any one ſhould be ſollicitous how he ought to come into death and corruption, for it comes in its own time, and cannot be ſuppreſt: as a woman big with child, when the hour of the birth comes, cannot hinder it, Whatever a man knows and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands in this death, it is contrary to him for it is as it were a ditch in which he lies putrifying and corrupting. No ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, nor underſtanding delighteth him.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:137210:111"/>If yet he could be delighted with any thing, he would alſo ſtill live. What ſoever therefore he hath, applieth, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or handleth, it is all done in death, and he himſelf is detained in death, that he may putrefie, and corrupt, even unto the corporal death, and this is that end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or concluſion of the natural man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now as this dead man hath, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſpeaketh, thinketh, and applieth all things infected with death, and lies as it were in a ditch, in which he putrefieth: ſo on the contrary a living man hath, underſtandeth, ſpeaketh, thinketh, and uſeth all things qualified with life; and as the other is in a grave, ſo this is in the houſe of joy, where he eats, drinks, dances, ſings, till he alſo comes into death, then all theſe things ceaſe, and he can receive none of them. The Natural man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tranſcendeth imagination: and though he becometh ſo high therein, that he dares to touch God, yet even then is he overthrown, as it is written: Though he ſhould build his neſt in heaven, yet thence will God throw him down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. Then all is done with him, as
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:137210:112"/>with that rich man, who cloathed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gorgeouſly, and was fed with the daintieſt food, but after all that, he dyed and was buried; and then, whatever had been pleaſant, departed from his Soul, and could no longer receive it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his prayers were not heard. Yet his mind is, in this place, ſeparated from Nature by the croſs, and is taken into God, and liveth in him, but Nature is detained in death, under the law of ſin, from which the mind is freed by the croſs, and ſtandeth under grace, ſerving the Law of God, and is free from ſin, from which Chriſt hath freed him: And ſo is repulſed by the mind, in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the humanity (<hi>Tawler</hi> calls it the lowermoſt powers) out of which the vitiouſneſs is ſo ejected, that it never can return thither again.</p>
                        <p>When the natural man did ſtand in his own increaſe, he did accompliſh that work according to his own will, that is, the will of Man: But when God hath gained to be in the place of ſelf, he ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth his work according to the will of God, but contrary to the will of man.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:137210:112"/>If a man follows his concupiſcence in ſmall things, he follows it alſo in great things, that which he muſt do, that he cannot omit. For it is a thing tried, and proved by experience: If therefore one would not follow his luſt in great things, he is not to follow it then in ſmall things: for he who is willing to omit great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, will alſo omit ſmaller. To be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ones ſelf as to Nature, and to ſuffer therein, is very pleaſant to the mind. For whatever is cut off from the fleſh, by reaſon of conſcience, is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conſcience. We muſt ſuffer in Nature for the ſake of conſcience, but not in conſcience for the ſake of Nature.</p>

                        <p>The ſhorteſt and uſefulleſt rule for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that every one ſhould ſatisfy his own conſcience.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not imitate them, who are in death, becauſe they do all things in death, which another would do in life. For that which is dead is free from every
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:137210:113"/>thing: Now to be thus free from things, is the ſame as to have no life in things. In whatſoever therefore one hath yet a life, he is not free from that thing, whence it follows, that he is to endeavour to his utmoſt to abſtain from it, if he would act rightly. (For we muſt ſatisfie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and in all things ſtudy to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to it.) If any one ſaith, that he is free from any thing, unleſs he did it with affliction and grief, but not with delight and pleaſure, he ſaith not the truth: For that is ſtill to him inſtead of a priſon, in which he is detained a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner: ſo that he is bound, and not free: therefore let no man deceive himſelf, nor boaſt before the time. He, who is to come into a more ſublime ſtate, muſt be lifted up thereunto in order, and by degrees, and it behooveth him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in thoſe ways which lead him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>We muſt beware of a double heart: Whoſoever is ingenious hateth it. The diſſembler, and the hypocrit have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an out-ſide fair ſhow: yet he will not indeed deſiſt from his luſts. For he
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:137210:114"/>does not think it to be his concern, to be led contrary to his own will. Fame and Glory is a ſhort and a vain joy.</p>
                        <p>The new creature is not an action, but a generation: we come unto it by the croſs: for the ways which lead thereunto are the Croſs and affliction.</p>

                        <p>WHen a man perceiveth, that he is willing to abide in his preſent ſtate, and to be at reſt, and to ſubſiſt in it, then the Spirit ceaſeth, and the man ſlips down out of the ſpirit, into the fleſh: there the rule or government of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is hindred, and the literal Kingdom is ſet up: there then is no longer a ſpiritual Kingdom, nor an increaſe, nor profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, but a going backwards, and a leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back again into the fleſh, and into the creature: And then beginneth hatred, and perſecution towards the adverſe part, that they will not ſo much as receive them
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:137210:117"/>into their houſe, that is, they will by no means come near them, for the ſake of that. And thus theſe muſt ſuffer by and from them, for the ſake of the Name of Chriſt, even as alſo they ſuffer in their fleſh, for the ſake of ſin, by the Law of ſin. For the fleſh of theſe perſons, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with its luſts and affections are, by the Law, lifted up from the earth, upon the croſs, and the luſts and appetites of Nature are cut off, and rejected by their objects, that they can no longer uſe them, nor draw life from them. The univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal increated Salvation hath in it ſelf no judgment concerning others: for really it is without judgment: nor hath it any need of any means, by which it may abſtain from judgment, becauſe it hath no ſuch thing in it ſelf. But proper Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation hath hitherto carried along with it, judgments, and if it muſt abſtain from them it muſt do it by ſome means, which the real Salvation wanteth: Now thoſe means are the creatures, for the eſſence is God himſelf, who endureth no creature.

                        <p>For ſome years together all things have fallen away from me: yet hitherto the chief and real death followed not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, as now it does. Death indeed was always preſent with me, but it was never eſſential death till now. For here
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:137210:118"/>a man lieth in death and deſtruction, nor can he take or uſe any diſcretion, nor think this, or that, nor conceive images, unleſs it be, that he lyes eſſentially in death, and that death is really preſent: And when, in this miſery, one begins to talk of theſe, or the other divine things, even for that, Nature is to be puniſhed again, and to be crucified with yet a more bitter death. Nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter in again, as ſhe went out, for here ſhe took breath again, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created; and yet there belongeth nothing to her, but deſtruction and death. They who lye in this affliction, if one propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to them any comfort of life, they eſteem it for poiſon, and for bitterneſs, and for adverſity, nor can they liſten to it. Even as if one who is lead into death, looking round about him, ſhould ſee all and every one to be dead, all whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he beholdeth, yea his kindred, and familiar friends: Here let it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, how great is that affliction, to be deſerted of all, and to draw life no where, and to be a captive and bond-ſlave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto death, even to the deſertion of all creatures</p>

                        <p>Into them, who lie down in death, Life cannot enter: They who have not yet lain down in death, and yet obey the governance of their conſcience ſtand in the midſt between Life and death: they
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:137210:120"/>are ſubject to great labour and ſtrife, who endeavour by the help of conſcience to ſuppreſs that life which they have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Theſe men, as yet, can know no death, until they come into that ſtate, but yet they believe it. They who are in death, even their very cogitations do lye in death, that they can be delighted with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th ng neither with God, nor with the creature. For if they could ſtill be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with any thing by thinking or cogitation, that would ſtill prove to be a life, which cannot be in this caſe.</p>
                        <p>It one placed under a naked ſword ſhould be asked, whether he took delight at that time in any thing, without doubt he would anſwer, that he ſat in death, nor could poſſibly fancy to himſelf any other thing, but a certain and a real death. If ſuch a one ſhould get up on his legs, to look about, on life, and things temporal, he would ſee nothing before him, but a cloud, that is judgment, and death. The ſtate of ſuch men is plainly miſerable and painful; nor is it to be wiſhed for: as if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we ſhould ſay: O would to God we were like ſuch or ſuch: but this is to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:137210:120"/>be wiſhed, that the will of God is to be accompliſhed in us, that we may bear it, and be united with it. Moreover thoſe men who thus lie in death, have little or no comelineſs in them, but are very much deformed, and therefore he who is converſant with them, muſt beware, leaſt he imitates their words or behaviours. For whatſoever they do, or omit to do, are ſilent in, or ſpeak, it's all performed in death, nor can any life, joy, comfort, or pleaſure lay hold of them in this ſtate. They are untouched by delectation and are filled with death.

                        <p>It is not wiſdom to reveal the folly of another, unleſs one hath a very lawful cauſe; elſe the buſineſs of another is not to be diſcovered. The art of God, is God himſelf, and it is taught by God, and infuſed without any means: although ſome certain things ſhould preceed, which have been uſeful ſo to diſpoſe a man, that God can immediately touch him. It's no art to have no care in great abundance,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:137210:123"/>but by care to abſtain in want, comes to this at length, not to be ſollicitous. If the eye be ſhut to luſt and appetite, we may endure much: Affliction can bring it ſo to paſs, as any one can deny himſelf in great things, which without affliction, he could never have renounced. He that is free from many, hath need alſo to be ſet free from himſelf, not that he be a captive to himſelf but be freed from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Many think, that they have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, which notwithſtanding they have not yet: He in whom diſcretion is to be found, both bitter and ſweet things muſt have been taſted by him. To be free in Conſcience from thoſe accuſations, which are wont to be made dayly, is a great gift of God, and that liberty can advance a man unto a notable growth, if he can uſe it rightly. No man knows, what he hath, but when he hath loſt the thing, then at length a man acknowledgeth what he once had. A man is full of the ſtudy of appropriation, ſo that he always thinks, that this or that is due unto him, and to be his, and that he hath a right unto that. He that ſtandeth in God, walks,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:137210:124"/>ſpeaks, thinks, and operates, as in the ſight of God, nor is he ſollicitous, how men do receive it.

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:137210:124"/>to me a light thing, and not grievous, but afterwards it became a running ſore. No man ought to uſe any liberty towards his neighbour: after that I had relieved my neighbour by my own proper trouble, and had transferred the burden from my neighbour upon my own ſelf, I found my ſelf notably advanced forwards. And when I did not ſo do, I was thereupon ſtill under blame, for in this very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular I walked not in the ſight of God. If a man muſt be advanced, it behooves him to be quick-ſighted, that he may rightly converſe with his neighbour. It is often times neceſſary, that one ſhould neglect his exerciſes and his zeal for the ſake of his neighbour, and he ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himſelf unto God, nor ſhall he therefore ſuffer any damage. The levite and the Prieſt would not perform that; becauſe they were about their buſineſs, and had their exerciſes, and took care of themſelves, but left their wounded neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour without help, applying to him no compaſſion. There was a true cauſe which yet they did not obſerve, whence alſo it was, that they were not praiſed of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:137210:125"/>the Lord. A man attends fervently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prayer, and yet let him rightly weigh the cauſes of things: and God will know he is to be advanced. Oftentimes an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement ſpringeth from ſuch a thing, out of which there ſeemed, that an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance would ariſe.</p>
                        <p>When a man obſerveth his conſcience, then is he always more and more ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that ſometimes he knows not which way to turn himſelf.</p>
                        <p>To neglect all things, unto which luſt reacheth out its hand, and not to uſe them afflicteth a man: When Nature is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, then is not a man rejoyced, though he hath the affluence of all things nor is he made ſorrowful, though they ſhould be wanted: if good things do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound yet they are not his: for he cannot enjoy them truly, ſo as to have a life in them: but if they be wanting, he hath loſt nothing. Wherefore he paſſeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both parts unconcerned, neither being rejoyced in thoſe, nor made ſorrow in theſe.</p>
                        <p>To deny ones proper commodity and gain; and for our neighbours ſake and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:137210:125"/>advantage to ſuffer detriment, affecteth the conſcience with great pleaſure: but if one ſeeks commodity and gain, by the detriment of his neighbour, or advantage by his neighbour's in jury, or honour by his neighbour's diſgrace, then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cannot be at reſt, and at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes grievouſly gauled. Much is placed in this point, ſo that he who deſires to be advanced let him rightly uſe or handle his neighbour, let him walk with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent exerciſings, and with ſeverity, as under the Law, and in all things, let him obſerve his conſcience. He that ſpareth himſelf and does detriment to his neighbour, rather then to himſelf he can never be advanced. Alſo a man ought not to admit without lawful cauſes, that his neighbour ſhould ſerve him.</p>
                        <p>That the Fathers of old did ſo openly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void gormandizing, and gluttony, this was the reaſon, that gluttony is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the vices, under which all vices are contained. Gluttony is the bull-work and defence of all the other vices, which being broken down, they can no longer maintain a war, but the man goes on to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:137210:126"/>fight them, and to get the victory, and one victory after another, till, by God's help, he quite conquereth his carnal life, and begins a happy life, that ſo the fleſh being corrupted and undone, the Soul begins to bud forth, and is gained. But when afterwards theſe things are again to be loſt, certainly that death and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is much greater, then was the death of the fleſh.</p>
                        <p>In things neceſſary, as meats, drinks, ſleep, cloaths, &amp;c. they ought always to be only ſo taken as Nature can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented therewith, and not that pleaſure or joy may ariſe out of them. Such a uſe of them takes away all ſuperfluity, ſo that Neceſſity only may remain as in the ſight of God.</p>
                        <p>Time is to be eſteemed as too precious and worthy then to be ſquandred away in the reading of unprofitable books. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ought to be above all caſes, not ought any caſe to prevail at all, if it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt conſcience.</p>
                        <p>Carnal afflictions, ſuch as are theſe, to be ſpoiled for the ſake of the word of God, to ſuffer perſecution, to be captivated, to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:137210:126"/>be tormented, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe, I ſay, I have not tried, but I highly eſteem them, and the more, becauſe I have not experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them, rather then if I had experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them. That which is beyond Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity is to be omitted, and not uſed. If any thing exceeds Neceſſity, omit that: for it will be grateful to you, nor will you repent thereof, although, at preſent, it may afflict you. If you will not do thus, greater pains and afflictions will ariſe therefrom. That which is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent grateful, at length breeds ſorrows, and that which at preſent affecteth with ſorrow that at laſt will bring forth pleaſure. That which is ſweet at firſt, does at laſt give a bitter taſt. <hi>Boethius</hi> ſaith: <hi>The end of pleaſure is pain.</hi> Alſo he ſaith: <hi>There is no ſin without pain, and affliction, as there is no virtue without its reward.</hi> A man cannot be inwardly advanced, nor have peace and reſt, unleſs outwardly he be withdrawn from all things, in which he liveth, and which he deſireth, and luſteth after, and is imployed about ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and mean objects: But thence reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth great affliction, without which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:137210:127"/>no man is advanced. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is the food of the Soul: To dye to the fleſh is the life of the Soul: Diſquiet, affliction, and pain, as to the fleſh, is peace, joy, and pleaſure to the Soul: for the one is alſo contrary to the other.</p>

                        <p>IT is neceſſary that a man ſhould be made aſhamed in all things, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be given to God alone. We muſt condole with our neighbour: if one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do that, yet muſt he hold his tongue, and abſtain from raſh judgment.</p>
                        <p>When all things ſucceed to a man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Nature, pleaſure, appetite, and proper commodity, theſe are not the means of advancing him towards God: but when all things go with a man againſt Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> otherwiſe then Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requireth, and againſt delight, and appetite, then whole dayes are conſumed in afflictions, and then one may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in God.

Therefore proſperous things are not to be ſought, nor adverſity to be avoided. For adverſity is always ſafe, and does advance us in the Knowledge of our ſelves.

I never before had believed, that the caſe would be thus, as now I find it. Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth ſo drive me, that I can have neither comfort, nor hope, nor faith, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in God, or in the creature: Thus the Natural Man is ſuppreſſed by judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thus the rod hangeth over him, and which way ſoever he looks death meets him: but the mind is free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have no torture of Soul, and ſuch ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings as <hi>Francis Spira</hi> endured, I am ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of them.</p>

                           <hi>Adam</hi> was created pure in ſpirit, Soul
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:137210:128"/>and Body; but by his fall he departed from God, and tumbled down into his ownſelf: he became eſtranged from God, and was made his own propriety, and a ſervant of the creatures. And this ſame growth of ſelf, is nothing elſe but our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, endeavour, or ſtudy of appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to our ſelves, which afterwards is ſo ſubjected unto judgment, that it can have no comfort, or life either in God or in the creature. Therefore it behoov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to be reduced again into nothing, in reſpect of all things about which we are made ſomewhat, and then at length God will be all himſelf, in the man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that inſtead of his own proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and then a Man is reſtored without propriety: And then a man findeth God with God, and ſerveth God with God, and that is pleaſing to God: For God hath no good pleaſure but in his ownſelf. Judgment is exerciſed upon this his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and then that loſeth all hope of reſtitution, and nothing is due unto it, either as to God, or as to the creature, Thus it may be underſtood, what the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> is, <hi>viz.</hi> appropriation: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                        <p>WIthout affliction it is impoſſible to be promoted in God, and to have inward peace: for where one is to be promoted, or advanced in God, and to have inward peace, there it behooveth the natural man to be purged from luſts, and to have no more delight, life, or joy in the creature, but to want all theſe, and to be ſuppreſſed in death, and to be faſtened to the croſs.

                           </gap> much time left, that my ſenſes can medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on ſuch a thing. It behooveth me to be ſtripped of the images of all things, and therefore I remain without purpoſe, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:137210:129"/>without councel, nor do I know, what in time to come I am to do, or leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, to be ſilent in, or to ſpeak; but as things are at preſent, ſo they glide away without my privitie: and when all things are paſt and done, I am no more ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous concerning them. My buſineſs is to attend that that is preſent, and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon me. That I thus ſuffer, it is not for my piety, but for evil, ſin, and propriety; becauſe I deſcend from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> over all whom, judgment, and death is impending, without hope of recovery. For whatſoever <hi>Adam</hi> hath, he hath it unjuſtly, he is therefore to be diſpoiled of all things, that he may want all things, and retain nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfort, nor pleaſure, nor joy, either as to God, or as to the creature: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is due unto him, nothing belongs unto him: he alſo himſelf can never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto any truth, but he is condemned, and dyeth in Chriſt. But whatſoever afterwards riſeth again in Chriſt, is clean, and without appropriation; That Chriſt hath condemned ſin it ſelf, is not to be underſtood, as if he had ſin in himſelf,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:137210:130"/>or he is pure, like the ſun, void of all impurity. Whence it is, that no unright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs can ſtand before him, but as filthineſs, it is condemned by him: juſt as in the Sun all impurity is detected, and demonſtrated to be impurity: So that the ſun cannot endure it, but rather deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>I lie like the trunck, of a tree, nor have I in me any activity, but I ſuffer only all that, that is done in me: but I cannot act ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſon, or by underſtanding: My ſtate is paſſive, not active: the active went before, and I alſo once had it, ſo as alſo it ought to be, or elſe I had not come unto this. Only it is not permitted to me, that I may or can act, or form in my ſelf the image of any thing.</p>
                        <p>We muſt ſuffer, even in the ſmalleſt matters: for he that refuſeth that, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be promoted in God: by the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:137210:130"/>of the ſpirit, the ſuggeſtions of Nature are to be denyed: that ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be given to the Spirit; no man ought to follow Nature, that ſo the will of God may be done, and not ours. The affliction and miſery of Nature, is to be ſuſtained for the ſake of God, and the peace of conſcience. <hi>It is better,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, to be invited unto green herbs with Love, then to a fatted calf with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</hi> Poverty of nature, with peace of conſcience is better, then the delight of Nature with anguiſh of conſcience. Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries are due unto Nature, that by their means, a man may be converted unto God, but not on the contrary. When the conſcience is ſatisfied, many ſorrows do invade nature: But <hi>Peter</hi> commands, that ſorrows are to be born for conſcience ſake, <hi>viz.</hi> Sorrows that are againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for conſcience ſake, but not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                        <p>When it was Summer ſeaſon to my Nature, the heat thereof did ſtay me, but now Winter is followed thereupon, yet the Summer is ſtill adjudged by me to be excellent and worthy, yea even when
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:137210:131"/>it's Winter time; but the will of God is more precious to me, then all things. My buſineſs or labour is increaſed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated, yet am I contented: I keep my ſorrows in ſilence: for if they ſhould burſt out, and be made publick, clamours, and complainings would dayly be heard from me, becauſe judgment is alwayes exerciſed upon me, without conſolation, nor can I have either delight, or joy, or life either in God, or in the creatures. At the beginning, for ſome time, I enjoyed comfort, when it was propounded to me, that I was no longer my own, and my goods were no longer mine, but his, with whom I ſhould be married. Theſe endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a while; but they quickly vaniſhed away again. And from that very time to this, I have been without comfort, nor can I ſet my ſelf to read in this condition, ſeeing it is not lawful for me to aſſume ſo many images: Nevertheleſs I eſteem of the Scripture at a high rate, for it is dear and precious to me. Juſt as he who takes not a thing into his mouth, cannot be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the taſt thereof, ſo alſo can no man underſtand, know, or comprehend
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:137210:131"/>this ſtate, unleſs he himſelf does experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it, and come up thereinto. The event or ſucceſs of things is plainly another thing, then we thought of, without the wiſdom, and beyond the underſtanding reaſon, or judgment of man. They who are in this ſtate, are not admitted to reaſon. When others admit comfort, theſe refuſe all conſolation: For whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can be ſaid, that they know: And yet even from thence, they can have no comfort.</p>

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:137210:132"/>that the power of God hath turned me therefrom and ſo kept me therein, for the ſake of which, the glory is not mine, but God's. If I ſometimes, out of ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent neceſſity, ſpeak of them (<hi>viz.

But if they were to be reached, there would be need of a more ſublime ſpirit. We muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, that we fall not back again into that, which we have once forſaken, and left by continence: yea we muſt have a care, that, if we have proceeded forwards, we ſlip not back again, and if we have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing, let us not loſe it again, for it was gotten with great hardſhip or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.</p>

                        <p>THe moſt ready and next way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency is this, that a man ſhould cloſely, and diligently obſerve whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pleaſeth, tempteth, or moveth his carnal appetite, and deny them all. By ſo doing a man ſometimes becomes ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed with miſery, that he knows not which way to turn himſelf, whence it is, that he is driven to his prayers.</p>
                        <p>If any one is willing to have all things done ſo accurately and according to his own mind he muſt, on that ſcore, ſuffer ſo many plagues, and for the ſake of one commodity, to indure two incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dityes in the ſtead thereof. A man
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:137210:133"/>ought to learn to bear, and ſuffer what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is contrary unto himſelf, elſe he can never come to reſt and peace. <hi>Tauler</hi> ſaith, Abſtain, and Suſtain, hold thy tongue, and hold thy peace: Patience only leadeth me into the ſtill reſt: Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is the food of the Soul. Yea in time of pure neceſſity, Patience is that bread of heaven, and that fulneſs or plenty kept ſecret in the Treaſure of God. Silence and patience quiet a man. To have no delight neither in God, nor in the creatures, but to periſh on both ſides, is the moſt miſerable, and deſolate of all conditions: If then thou askeſt; is there therefore no hope left for thee? I anſwer, thy caſe is now the very ſame, as if a grain of wheat, that at this time lyes in corruption, ſhould ask; whither or no there is any hope for it? For if there could be any hope in and to corruption, there would be no need, that the thing ſhould be corrupted; and he that hath hope, hath no need, that he ſhould die. In this death and annihilation the affliction is ſo great that a man knows not what he is to do: for which way ſoever he turns himſelf, he finds life, delight, or quiet
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:137210:133"/>no where, there meets him nothing but corruption, and death, and he himſelf acknowledgeth that this caſe is deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his, ſo that he cannot ſo much as ask that theſe things may be removed from him: he therefore does nothing, but bows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down, and ſhrinketh, ſaying, O Lord, O Lord! And that converſation he once had with God, with faith, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, labour, zeal, and ſeverity, doth plainly go down with him into the grave, and he no longer hath any thing, but lyes in the pit, in death, and annihilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuffers the will of God: and whatever he utters in words, concerning theſe things, he doth it all with grief, and not with pleaſure, and when he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he is involved in greater ſtreights, and difficulties; ſo that he had rather hold his tongue. Such then as can yet, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and freedom, talk of theſe matters, by this very talking, do they demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that they are not yet come unto this ſtate or condition, or unto this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, becauſe delight, and pleaſure is ſtill alive in them, and they are yet ſull of corrupt deſires, and appetites. And
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:137210:134"/>although they are drawn off from the loweſt dreggs yet are they turned quite to the other extreme. But yet ſuch are not to be reputed to be like the men, they were before: For now they are honeſt, whenas formerly they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt, and now they are become more averſe from themſelves, then they were before. Yet although they are now, in part made more noble, and more pure, yet for all that, there muſt come a death, even upon theſe good qualities, becauſe concupiſcence is ſtill preſent, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are only changed, and become more noble. And this is that ſame ſtate, and condition, which goes before that ſame death, corruption, and the grave; and muſt be brought to paſs, and no man can arrive thereat, unleſs it be given to him of God: for from him flows the helps and aſſiſtance, and that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the deſertion, and renouncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things, viſible and inferior, by means of many afflictions. This is that ſtate, to know Chriſt according to the fleſh, in which all things are to be left, before we come to the other deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:137210:134"/>where Chirſt appeareth and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged or known in ſpirit, nor doth he ever appear, as he did in the former or foregoing ſtate. To obſerve order in all things, and to be exorbitant in nothing, keeps the mind free: but when it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, there ariſe burdens, and cares; nor is there any liberty allowed for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable exerciſes, becauſe of the great heap of confuſions, that hinder the man. Whoever therefore would be freed from all pernitious imaginations, he ought to beware, that when he erred upon one hand, being turned therefrom, that he err not alſo on the other: for a burden awaiteth upon him on either ſide, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt pray unto God, to direct our external affairs, into a middle way, for that middle is between both extreams, good: Now this is ſaid concerning things neceſſary outwardly, but not of things internal, unleſs it be ſo far as externals have a reſpect to internals, and are ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable unto them; and if they be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordered, do promote them: for when they are diſorderly, they became an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to internal concerns, and do
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:137210:135"/>diſturb the man making him reſtleſs. Whereas if theſe things be performed with a turning unto God in fear, and in thankſgiving, then is it from God, and it is right, and the man is well enough, but elſe affliction waiteth on the fleſh.</p>

                        <p>WHatſoever hath received life, ought to dye. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>If ye live according to the fleſh, ye ſhall dye:</hi> in what thing ſoever a man placeth his life, according to the fleſh, in that very thing alſo he taketh his death, therefore he ought to beware, ſo as that he place his life in none of thoſe things in which there is no life. Juſt ſo bitter is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of dying, as was the life formerly ſweet. It is therefore neceſſary, that a man put always a curb upon himſelf, and that he keeps himſelf in priſon, as it were, leaſt he any ways ſtrayeth, and that he ſhould bound himſelf within nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row limits, and that he be in conſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Lord.

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:137210:135"/>for in ſuch, it is that the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and growth of a man conſiſteth, otherwiſe he is ſtunted. In the croſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, converſion and faith in Chriſt, is given; and there it is that we have or hear our anſwer. All fruit grows out of preſſure, affliction, and miſery, which is every where preſented, by things vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Let every one therefore become ſubject to the croſs, and let him not flie from it, at all, God knoweth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of every thing, and prepareth its end, how compaſſionately alſo doth he deal with us. No man ever periſhed, but he that did flee from the croſs, nor was willing to ſuffer outwardly, and inwardly too. Let not a man be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, proud, and lifted up, nor let him ſpeak ambitious words: but let him be humble, ſimple, and lowly, and let him poſſeſs his mind in holineſs, and in contrition, and let that appear in all his doings, in all his apparel, manners, words, and works, nor let him ever ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf proud and puffed up, nor having to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether therewith, the contempt of his neighbour.</p>

                        <p>A Man in affliction ought to abſtain from all delights of the creatures: nor ought he to ſeek for a comforter (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them) but place all in the Lord: Let him abide without comfort, without complaint, till the Lord cometh. Yea alſo let him reject all ſtrange waves of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and ſuch like evaſions, and let him wait for the Lord: for the Lord will
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:137210:138"/>approve himſelf faithful to him, and will ſuffer him to bear but in a juſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and order, and that to his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and for the promotion and growth of the man. All which, would a man hinder, if being impatient under the croſs, he ſhould not wait upon God. Great is the fruit of affliction and therefore in it, is the Lord to be expected. I expected the Lord from the morning watch, even until the evening, ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith: <hi>Bleſſed are all they that wait upon the Lord, for they that wait upon him ſhall never be confounded;</hi> the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>In waiting I waited upon the Lord and he regarded me.</hi> Now if there were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faithfulneſs nor good will in the Lord, of viſiting and helping his, the Scripture would never have repreſented theſe things to us, in aſmuch as it ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing but what is true. The Lord grant us Faith! <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>I believe all the things which are written in the Law and the Prophets.</hi> The eye of our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Love, and favour, is to be turned upon God, and in all things we ought to ſet him for our mark, and end, and not

The natural ſtate, by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> is this, that we ſhould turn our eyes upon thoſe things from whence ſprings up to us, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but blindneſs, and ignorance: which things alſo are again changed in a true change which tends to their original: but that then happeneth, with grief, and with anguiſh. Now he that caſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into that original, he arrives at the port of grace; and that is revealed to him, which he, before, knew not: for the imitation of Chriſt openeth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth, but the imitation of the fleſh hideth and ſhutteth.</p>
                        <p>In all things we are perverſe, until we come unto judgment, and death: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Lord ſhould exhibit himſelf unto us, and ſhould ſuſtain us, by his power, we ſhould all utterly periſh: whence we ought deſervedly to beware of all raſhneſs.</p>
                        <p>There is no need that a man ſhould be more ſollicitous about the getting of knowledge, then he ſhould be of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of death: for in death, things do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:137210:139"/>and give out themſelves, and true knowledge is unfolded; whereas if life ſhould remain that could not be effected, though a man ſhould ſtrive with never ſo much ſtudy and labour. Yea though he might get knowledge according to the letter, yet for all that, all things are ſtill ſhut up, and hidden from him, before he can yield himſelf up into death, and admit in himſelf the dying of the guilty body, ſuch ſtudyings, and endeavours after knowledge, are rather an hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, becauſe thereby a man neglecteth his own ſelf, and becomes forgetful of his own concerns. Of this alſo ſaith our Lord: <hi>What ſhall it profit a man to gain the whole World, and to loſe his own Soul.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That any one in this world ſhould not be ſolicitous nor feed carking care, many things are requiſit, for there are ſome who take no care at all; becauſe they labour not by reaſon of want, or penury: And many are ſuch by nature. Yet this is not that which our Lord ſaith: For the words of our Lord always point at ſome other thing, then what we derive from

                        <p>NEceſſary affairs are done, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the choſen of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the cleaving or ſticking of their hearts unto them: And if it be not thus, but that the heart is rather burdened with them, and is involved in imaginations, this is not thorough any fault in the things, but becauſe of that defect, that ſtill abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in man. And thus a man goes away blinded, not knowing himſelf, until he falleth into temptation or tryal. But when he comes to a feeling knowledge of himſelf, then he may be advanced; which could never be done afore; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had to do with ſin ſecretly. That which a man ſometimes thought was hurtful to him, and his hinderance, that afterwards ſerves to advance, and put
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:137210:140"/>him forwards: Therefore ſhould a man remain without any choice of his own, but wait what God will do with him, and thus yield himſelf up, as being bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the divine will.</p>
                        <p>Here is the communion of Saints, and that in the higheſt degree; Let therefore the loweſt degree bluſh that even it alſo doth not earneſtly long after this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: for if the Sun gives himſelf forth in common, certainly then the Moon ought to do the like, who elſe ought to be aſhamed, if ſhe ſhould claim to her ſelf too great a propriety, and arrogate all to be hers. He who is ſwallowed up by created things, feeles from them either a pleaſure, or a pain, even to joy, or grief; ſo as he can have no peace: But he who is free from them, is free alſo from both thoſe evils, ſo that neither what is pleaſant, neither what is ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, neither gladneſs, nor ſorrow reacheth him. And becauſe joy hath no place in him, neither alſo doth ſorrow touch him, if things do happen other ways, then joy and deſire do expect and ask. To ſtand between comfort and diſcomfort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:137210:141"/>joy and grief, and to remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, and unmoved by either, is a great liberty, and the gift of God, for no man hath that of or from himſelf: Yea let no man unduely think that he hath gotten that, for many things are required before we can arrive at this ſtate or condition; and when we are come thither, yet is not glory thereof belonging to man, but to God alone. And thus man is to abide in humility without judging, or contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others.</p>

                        <p>SIn is hated in a double ſenſe, and that by divers ſorts of perſons. For ſome do hate ſin, becauſe of affliction: they thereby being afflicted, and terrified in their conſciences, as alſo becauſe of the loſs they ſuſtain by it, as the loſs of their ſouls, of heaven, and of eternal ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if theſe two were not, <hi>viz.</hi> the torment of conſcience, and the loſs of heaven, they could love ſin, and be friends with it, yea become to be united and to be in league therewith. And
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:137210:141"/>it is thus proved, becauſe that ſame ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſin, proceeds not from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the mind nor from regeneration; in as much as there is, in this ſtate, ſtill left the old life, to which belongeth judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and condemnation, and is that that muſt dye the death. Whereas others, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as are tranſplanted into God, do hate ſin, out of the Nature of their mindes, and out of regeneration. For the new life which is in them, will not bear ſin, nor ſuffer it to be: and that not becauſe of that torment of conſcience, or loſs of ſalvation, but out of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by reaſon of its tenderneſs, and its holy temper. For this nature can endure nothing that is ſtrange, for it is the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Chriſt Jeſus, who is God himſelf. Hence is it that theſe two Sorts do thus differ one from another: The firſt is, when ſome are the enemies of ſin for their own ſakes, when as, by nature, they are ſtill friends. But the other, and ſecond ſort is, when it hath loſt (ipſeity or) propriety, and hateth ſin by nature, for ſuch are in God, and, being new creatures, have attained a new ſenſe,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:137210:142"/>which is ſpiritual: Whereas the former ſort, is ſtill natural, and hath a natural ſenſe; whence they wear about them, not the new, but the old creature. Yet they are well enough in their own kind, and their ſtate, or condition precedeth the latter, or ſecond, and waites for it.

                        <p>We ought not to be troubleſome to one another in geſtures, or words, or works, or thoughts, but every where to ſeek peace in love.

Sin muſt be ſtarved to death, and as it is uſual to deal with a feaver; neither food is to be given to it, and wherever it would put forth it ſelf, it is to be hindred from growing.

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:137210:144"/>nor go about it like one that is about to tempt God. We ought with fear, and terrour, yea with great trembling appear before God in prayer, and therefore we ought to be prepared, before we pray. Poverty and affliction teach us to pray. By how much greater the affliction is, by ſo much the more peircing will the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be.</p>
                        <p>We are to endeavour not to ſeem, or profeſs our ſelves otherwiſe before men, then we profeſs our ſelves before God: For men before men, ſeem to be ſomewhat, when yet before God, they be ſtill as a nothing in the bottom: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they deceive themſelves.</p>

                        <p>A Man ought not openly to reveal his divine exerciſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that, by which he is exerciſed by God.

                        <p>THis year proved more difficult, or hard to me, then it was ever before in all my life, and yet I did moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately weigh, and ponder on that ſame time. For by how much the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, any one aſcendeth in affliction, by ſo much the more accurately doth he weigh and count his time, and it proves thereby more profitable to him. All the foregoing time of mine, which I had ſpent before this year, vaniſhed away, and came to nothing, even as this my preſent time alſo ſhall vapour away into nothing: becauſe my body is annihilated. I have no ſupport, hence is it, that times becomes ſo tedious to me; but when time is ſpent in labour, it produceth no difficulty. But when I am deprived of all my ſtrength, I can neither pray, nor deſire, nor lift up one thought to God; Yea here I lye, and corrupt in body, mind, and ſpirit, as long as breath remaineth in me: Yea as to my underſtanding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and my reaſon, I am reduced to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:137210:148"/>As for my underſtanding, I know nothing of it, whither, <hi>viz.</hi> I have an underſtanding or not, for in this great gulfe of miſery, all things are reduced to duſt, and aſhes. Here I lye, and am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of nothing, but judgment, death, and condemnation. And when one ſaid to him, is it ſo, that when thou art ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, preſently judgment is at hand? he anſwered, Am I accuſed? (not as though I were ſo perfect, as that I could not be accuſed) but if it were poſſible for me to take up life in ſuch a moment of time, as that accuſation might aſſault me in, even in that very moment ſhould I be blown into meer atoms. But I have not ſo much time left me, becauſe as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moments of my life as yet remain, ſo many judgments, and deaths do I ſuffer. I lye as it were in a thick dark cloud, and ſee nothing; oh how very ſmall, weak, and dim is that poor ray of light, that is round about me! I cannot ſee far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, yea neither doth my way, and path appear to my ſight; yea I am lead on where no way is, and that which is life to another, that is death to me, and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:137210:148"/>contrarily, that which is anothers death is my life. Judgment is ſo ſharp to me, as it is when one, not thinking any thing, layes his hand upon ſome place, and preſently ſome body knocks him on the fingers. When any would reply upon him, that this caſe was a certain kind of preſervation from God, becauſe he laid his hand ſo faithfully upon thee: he ſtill anſwered; True indeed this condition is the moſt ſafe before the eyes of God, but the moſt afflicted one in my ſight. For if I ſhould acknowledge this ſtate to be ſafe, forthwith another judgment is to be undergone by me. For plainly, I am lead without knowledge, without being acquainted, or underſtanding the way. For he who hath experienced the thing its ſelf, and he that hath been lead in this way, only notionally, are vaſtly differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe true knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, is ſuch a life, ſuch a prop, that a man comes then only to know them when God withdraws them from him. Juſt as when one laboureth with great thirſt, and ſees a pot ſtand before him, yet for all that, his thirſt cannot but afflict him
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:137210:149"/>ſtill: but then if there ſhould come one who ſhould take the pot quite away, then remaineth no hopes of ever attaining to drink thereof. All the Elect are brought unto God thorough affliction, but all do not tread this ſame path of the croſs, by which I am to paſs.</p>

                        <p>ANd now I ſhall bid you farewel, for perhaps it is determined, that I may ſpeak no more. I will recommend my ſelf to the Lord. See that ye labour and walk in all conſcience, before God: Love your brothers, and ſiſters, as your own ſelves, and take care of them, otherwiſe judgment will come upon you. This you muſt do, that when you ſhall lye, as I now lye, ye may lye with a quiet heart. Behave your ſelves in all things uprightly, and ſeek after the ſalvation of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:137210:150"/>your Souls: for ſalvation is of greater price then mony, or all goods. Mony, with its goods periſh together, but ſalvation brings peace to the heart of Man. Let me depart from you in freedom: from my death (as I hope) a living motion will ſpring up in you. I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to the Lord, who can freely beſtow on you wiſdom, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all other neceſſaries in a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold. The Lord will preſently give me reſt, I expect, and wait for eternal reſt. I am to ſuffer ſo long as the Lord will have me. If I had known this affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction before now, I ſhould have dyed for meer grief. O inward deſertion! O deſolation (<hi>Wiſdom</hi> 1.) which now ſtands ready at hand! I deſire to be the moſt vile of all, and only long for the crums which fall from the childrens table. If I could have avoided this affliction yet I would not, for my conſcience hath bound me to abide by it. Miſery, in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, is great: a man would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be lead with certainty, but yet is he lead with uncertianty, and it is, as if one ſhould journey by night, and yet not
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:137210:150"/>know the way; when (beſides) the waters are out, he may chance to fall, and yet he muſt go forwards. Yet is he ſecretly lead by God, and when the morning ariſes, he ſhall ſee, that the buſineſs hath ſucceeded well enough. In affliction nothing is known, how that a man is ſuſtained, and taken care of, but at laſt it is acknowledged, and then it is known, that God was always preſent, even in his deſertion. The higheſt affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction doth manifeſt, that ſelfiſhneſs, or propriety which yet was before undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: and God prepareth a man for this higheſt of afflictions. All things are ſnatched from me, even before my face, yet I know what I am to do; I will beg of God a favourable death for my ſelf. O Lord behold thy miſerable creature. O Lord imbrace me, for all things are from thee. O Lord imbrace all my powers, and ſtrength, and grant ſtrength unto me, in this my deepeſt miſery: Here I ly before thee like a moſt wretched worm: All the affliction which I have hitherto ſuffered, is nothing to this miſery.</p>

                  <p>WHo art a Chriſtian in good earneſt before I ſhall begin to relate any thing of this little tract, or of it's original or ſubject, I am willing faithfully to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort thee as alſo moſt earneſtly to beſeech thee, that thou diligently callſt upon God for illumination, and for the opening of the Eyes of thy underſtanding, whereby thou mayeſt be enabled according to his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, rightly to underſtand, that which is here propoſed, which being by the grace of God performed, thou ſhalt in very deed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:137210:152"/>that this book will be very uſeful and profitable unto thee, ſeeing it is every where filled with the moſt excellent and choice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which are able to lead thee unto the true judgment of many points. Nor does it only bring moſt notable advantage to thee only, but alſo to all the Elect, who duly, and according to true knowledg, have a zeal for God, but to ſuch as are perverſe, and behold all things with perverſe and blind Eyes, theſe things will without doubt, ſeem to be full of dulneſs, and fooliſhneſs. O that our eyes were ſingle, then certainly we ſhould eaſily perceive that theſe Epiſtles and ſayings have not flowed from humane wiſdome, nor through the dead letter <hi>(as to the more divine ſenſes) nor from the outward bark only,</hi> but from the inſtinct of the holy Spirit, and that he who wrote, and ſpoke theſe, to have been, indeed, a man divinely illuminated, and a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate friend of God, and that he learnt and drew theſe truths out from the book of his croſs, and by the means of his inward Sorrows in the School of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But let us make our approach nearer, to the thing intended, and that we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:137210:153"/>a few things concerning the original of this ſmall treatiſe, let the hearty Reader know, that the aforeſaid-friend of God, wrote theſe Epiſtles to his familiars, and friends, ſeperated from his dwelling, in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; to every one according to his condition, to ſtir up their zeale, by no other means, then the ſtudy of ſimplicity: with no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have them afterwards printed, and publiſhed, inſomuch as that, after his death they being by ſome honeſt hearted ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, collected together, were thus put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into one Volume. But thoſe ſayings of his, he himſelf wrote not, but only ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them orally. And this was his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful counſel, that every one ought to ſeek the thing there, where he himſelf had ſought, and found it, and in which place only it can be found and gotten, <hi>viz.</hi> In God, the ever ſpringing fountain of all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and goodneſs, and from whom flow theſe living ſtreams; neither may any one (who is not willing to be deceived) draw them from ſtrange muddy Ciſterns or Lakes.</p>
                  <p>Now by what means thoſe his ſayings were (he not knowing it) taken from his mouth,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:137210:153"/>and comprehended in one volume, we ſhall briefly declare.</p>
                  <p>This moſt religious Matthew (amongſt thoſe of his family) bred up an honeſt young man, whoſe name was <hi>John Spee,</hi> filled with an earneſt fervor, and Zeale for the divine glory. This perſon was daily with him, ſo that, as there was occaſion, he heard his ſpeeches with his friends, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars, that came from ſeveral places to viſit him; as alſo ſuch diſcourſes as he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently had with himſelf. All therefore what ever he had heard, being well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed upon his mind, and memory, when the diſcourſe was ended, he in his own cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, faithfully committed it to writing: nor did he in the leaſt acquaint any one with them, even to his laſt breath. But then, when he was about to die, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to his friends, who ſtood by, that he had privily committed thoſe ſayings to writing, as they would find them amongſt his written-papers. Now why that treatiſe of his ſayings was divided into three parts, the reaſon was, becauſe the aforeſaid <hi>John Spee,</hi> by reaſon of his own private affairs, went away twice, and conſequently
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:137210:154"/>had ordered, according to each ſpace of time, a part diſtinct by it ſelf even as they were afterwards kept, divided, and are here printed. But the diſtinction or diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution into Chapters and Verſes was done by another, for the Readers ſake, that by the guidance of a Table, every particular point might be the more conveniently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after, and be found out.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, as to the forementioned <hi>John Spee.</hi> This may be ſaid of him: He was an unmarried Young Man, deſcended of a Noble Family, very pious, and having a manifeſt warmth and Zeale. This man ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was bleſſed of the Lord, with the true knowledge of the moſt holy Goſpel, having bid adieu to the world, dayly ſtudied and ſearched into the Holy Scriptures, being, with all his might, intent thereon, ſo that he might but arrive at the true knowledge of himſelf. And when he ſaw that youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful luſts, according to the fleſh, did ſtrive to get dominion over his ſoul, and upon all ſides, ruſhed in upon him, he began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe himſelf with all his utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, in watchings, and faſtings dayly, and both night and day, tiring himſelf
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:137210:154"/>out with prayers; that he might reſiſt thoſe invading luſts, and caſt a bridle over them. And when he obſerved, that ſin did not yet ceaſe from his Soul, and mind, he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a more hard, or ſtrict courſe of life, with all ſeverity, which he continued even to his death, out living the moſt pious <hi>Matthew</hi> eleven Months only, for he then died, and was carried into the true reſt from all his labours on the ſecond of <hi>March 1561.</hi> May our merciful Lord and God, grant to us all, his compaſſion, and graciouſly help us that we may in his good time be ſet free from al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </head>
                     <p>WHereas, I certainly find in thee, a deſire greatly enflamed, and that thy ſoul even burns with a thirſty longing after the gaining the moſt clear perception of true divine Grace, manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt our Saviour, I could not reſt contented, until, taking this matter in hand, I ſhould endeavour briefly to ſhew to thee what that is, that can conduct, or lead thee thereunto, whereby thoſe
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:137210:155"/>things may be the better diſcovered to thy ſight, which are here a hinderance to thee, ſo that they being rejected, thou mayeſt with fear beware of what hides thy light with thick darkneſs.</p>
                     <p>For it is impoſſible, whilſt there yet remains but one only (yea though it be the leaſt) root of ſin in which a man ſtill perſiſts, that he can ever arrive at ſuch a degree of Grace, becauſe at the time that Regeneration is perfected, when by that clear light, above nature, manifeſted to, and in a man by the holy Spirit, that ſame enmity, that is interpoſed between him and God, is repreſented to him, no iniquity, nor any accuſation of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ought to be found in him; Yea ſo pure muſt that regeneration be, that that man, as far as he is conſcious to himſelf, ſhould have nothing, either in Heaven, or in Earth, which he ſhall not have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready reſigned up, ſo as to be ready with a moſt ardent zeal, to forſake all things, for the ſake of God; Yea, he ſhall never have need further to ſuſtain even the leaſt check of conſcience, but ſhall have beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en back all by a moſt invincible perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:137210:156"/>in fighting, and ſhall have ſupplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all whatſoever may diſturb his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, inſomuch, that by theſe means, his ſoul may at laſt arrive to have a conſcience in full peace, and void of all accuſations.</p>
                     <p>For often times a man thinks that he is come to the cutting off many wicked inclinations, and that then he is in little or no want, and that chiefly, becauſe that which is the quite contrary, whereby it's poſſible for him to be corrupted, is not manifeſtly made known to him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if all that, was a little more clearly manifeſted to him, he would certainly then, very readily apprehend, that he was yet at a far greater diſtance from that degree of a more purified conſcience.</p>
                     <p>Seeing therefore this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of man that his unrighteouſneſs and wickedneſs is greater then he can know, therefore all ſuch things, as fall within his ſight, are alwayes to be by him ſedulouſly cut off: for he neither can ſooner be able to perceive thoſe ſins which are unknown to him, or ſhall he obſerve depravities, which were not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore underſtood, but by thus doing. For
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:137210:156"/>ſo long as a man liveth ſlothfully in known ſins, the ſins that are unknown, will not ſhew themſelves: whence it comes to paſs, that a man living at this rate, commonly remains in darkneſs, and the light never comes to ſhoote forth it's beams manifeſtly in him. For when he ſhall have rooted out thoſe ſins that dayly rack his conſcience, there preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will ariſe in their ſtead another new accuſation of his conſcience, which was, till now, unknown to him, ſeeing that ſame field of accuſations will never be barren even to the laſt moment of the combate. Wherefore the aforeſaid vices are not laid open, even to the very bottom of his nature, unleſs they ſhew their faces by degrees, and that even from the very firſt entrance into the combate, to the very point of time, when the ſtrivings, with the accuſing ſin, are finiſhed by afflictions, and through the croſs; the Soul, at laſt, gaining her freedome from, and becoming conquereſs over them all, in a conſcience truly pure, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purged, apprehending nothing at all, either within, or without her ſelf (as far
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:137210:157"/>as it is truly poſſible for a man, to ſee, and know after a moſt exact ſcrutiny made by the power of God) which ſhe hath not fully reſigned up, and denied herſelf in. And to declare it in ſhort, upon this very point turns the hinge of the matter, and unto this ought all ſuch, as earneſtly endeavour after the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of reſt, and peace, with their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diligence, to reach after it with their whole heart, and to Inſtitute their lives, accordingly thereunto; unleſs they are willing to try how it will be, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, and drawn hither, and thither, by a wavering kind of zeale, nor ever to get free from accuſations of that ſort, and much leſs to be ſtrengthened by a firm Faith of mind, but to be alwaies vexed, and tormented with anxious thoughts of heart, partly through the ſo often repeated pangs, and pricks of conſcience, inwardly, and partly by the unſpeakable hot zeal, of the many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, about the truth, outwardly, they become wracked in ſo miſerable a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that at the laſt they grow wholly ignorant which way to take, or turn themſelves.</p>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:137210:157"/>
                     <p>For ſo long as a man is ſtill held cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in himſelf, by any kind of iniquity whatſoever, and is in the inwards of his ſoul, privately accuſed of it, and yet he gives no due heed thereunto, being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, how he may get free there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, and ſtudieth and endeavoureth, what he can to defend it, either by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-ſayings or by ſome other waies, which ſtill hold him in this errour, nor yet is he, for all this, freed from it in his mind (his conſcience all this while freely prompting, and telling him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he doth well, or ill) and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he endeavoureth to pacifie his conſcience, by theſe, or ſuch like waies, yet he ſhall find that all this his labour is loſt, when he ſhall ſee that this ſame ſecret accuſation, and laying of blame upon him, before his judge, will never give over, or ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>In this point therefore let every one try himſelf, and let no man deceive himſelf, flattering himſelf with ſugred words, for the day will manifeſt all things, whether we be willing or not, yea all whatever we now gladly hide in
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:137210:158"/>the bottome of our hearts, and yet do deny and diſown them.</p>
                     <p>If therefore we ſay: I confeſs my faults: I confeſs my ſelf to be as miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and as perverſe a ſinful man, as can be found any where; Go to then, let us endeavour, that that for which we are to be accounted Sinners, be taken from us, and that we be turned from all unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. For the bare confeſſion of ſins makes no Man innocent, but the very rooting out of ſin. For as long as any Man is accuſed of any iniquity, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe action yet remaining, even ſo long is it, that he is ſtill in bondage, nor are his Sins forgiven him: it is therefore ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, that he ſhould quite extirpate all ſuch, and after the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof is made in himſelf, that he execute the ſentence, that he may for ever die to that unrighteouſneſs: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as that there be left in him no ſuch purpoſe of ever doing again, any the like iniquity; ſo that, all being thus brought under, there may remain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing covered, or ſecretly hidden in his Soul, which he ſhall not wholly deſiſt
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:137210:158"/>from, in the true ſimplicity of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and that he become pure, and wholly cleanſed according to the utmoſt and beſt of the knowledge of himſelf in his own breaſt.</p>
                     <p>Then at length the Lord in his own time may for this Man's good meet him, as being manifeſted to him, through ſome very great temptation, and may force him upon ſome anxious, and horrible combate; which the poor wretch had not in the leaſt foreſeen, nor even then neither, could underſtand, untill all was paſt, and finiſhed. Then it is, that he who, before that, ſeemed to himſelf, to have arrived at a true innocence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in himſelf, is ſet at the bar of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine judgment, and from the opinion of being highly lifted up, or advanced, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as he ſeemed to himſelf to touch the very Heavens, he is thrown down to the nethermoſt place of ſome moſt deep humiliation, even like Hell it ſelf. Then is he blown upon, and purged by the true fire of divine Judgment, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led within him; and the enmity that is interpoſed betwixt God and him, doth
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:137210:159"/>dayly decreaſe through Jeſus Chriſt, who now at laſt doth begin to perform in him, the proper buſineſs of his office, and is about to reduce him, unto the Image of his death, burial, and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, whereby at length he may be brought to the true union of a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine conſtitution in Chriſt, together with the hope of a glory to come, which ſhall never more be changed, even ſuch as ſhall be manifeſted to all, who with their whole heart, and in truth are Lovers of God above all.</p>
                     <p>Whoever he is that is brought unto this eminent rejection, as alſo to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of himſelf, he, as to the inward man, is afflicted with moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſtreights and difficulties, before he can be arrived there-at, inſomuch as he becomes willing to renounce, ſubmit, reſign up, yea and to account for, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, all that treaſure, he hath ſcrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together from opinion, and that ſtrange high flown exaltation, yea and all that liberty, which is born together with us in our firſt natural generation. Which being full effected, at length
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:137210:159"/>there ſucceeds the revelation of the glory of Chriſt, whoſe likeneſs he, by little and little, grows ſenſible of, and which obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus gradually to increaſe in him, he catcheth with great earneſtneſs, inasmuch as it preſenteth to him wonderful promiſes.</p>
                     <p>Now this laſt ſtate being arrived at, he ſtill becomes more and more averſe from all things paſt; and by how much the more this ſame averſation increaſeth, by ſo much the more plentifully do things following ſucceed in the place of the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, inſomuch as at length he becomes quite freed, in due time, from the ſpeech, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, underſtanding, counſels, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which hitherto he had exerciſed himſelf in, as to the creature, and was lead from infancy to perfect mandhood, according to the meaſure of his age in the fulneſs of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But now there are ſome who are fully contented with their own zeal, and think themſelves altogether certain, and ſure of that reconciliation which is acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt: Now whether this be truly ſo or no, ſhall be, at laſt, then made manifeſt, when the ſecrets of all hearts
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:137210:160"/>from the very bottom of their Souls ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> be laid open thorough him, who ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the hearts and trieth the reins, and will render to every one according to the works of his hands. Whereas if whilſt they yet enjoy the breath of life, they themſelves ſearching narrowly into their own boſoms, would commit or leave their courſe to the ſecret accuſation of their hearts, and would not cloak their ſins with ſuch or ſuch reaſons, or alſo with ſome ſayings of the Scriptures (miſapplied or ill underſtood and uſed) then would they fully perceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be yet far away removed from that reconciliation, that is given by Chriſt, and would find in themſelves nothing but the wrath of God; from which yet they cannot truly get free, unleſs they can come into Chriſt and the image of him, and conſequently feel ſenſibly in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Reconciliation, Freedom, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, not without, but within their own ſelves; and thereof to become perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in themſelves, not by an undue diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reading of the Scriptures, or from ſome kind of opinion of their own, make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:137210:160"/>more aſſured, or may expect or receive it from any creature whatſoever, but feelingly, livingly, and internally, being convinced in their own hearts, do truly become ſenſible of the higheſt love in the deepeſt enmity; of the greateſt riches, in the extreameſt poverty; of the profoundeſt joy in the moſt preſſing ſtreights, and miſery; and in the fierceſt combat, the ſweeteſt peace, and (in a word) in the loweſt deſpondencies and weakneſs, yea deſperation and inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the higheſt faithfulneſs and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ought to be found in God.</p>
                     <p>Here Faith comes to be tryed, whether it be of man, or whether it be of God: for if it be of man, it refuſeth to chooſe for it ſelf true poverty of Spirit, together with the abnegation of proper happineſs, which it elected for it ſelf; for it denieth to aſſume for its conſervation and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, any thing but what is before its own eyes, and is promiſed in words groſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood from the Scriptures, and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſces in the doing of them only, that the Soul may be ſaved: but if ſome things ſeem to it to be impoſſible to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:137210:161"/>it layes all that upon the ſhoulders of Chriſt, as without and beyond it ſelf, and ſo quiets its own conſcience in the beſt manner it can be poſſibly performed. When as if from the moſt inward ſecrets of its own Soul, it would confeſs the truth, it would indeed tell you of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience not ſoundly pacified, but rather of one that gnaweth and tormenteth, unleſs it ſtrives of ſet purpoſe to hide the true ſtate of the matter.</p>
                     <p>But if ſuch a one be about to object and ſay; This is the Devil, that thus accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and blameth a man, in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, from which notwithſtanding any one may be freed, by and thorough Chriſt. Well then! it this is the Devil, that thus accuſeth him without any Lie, and yet, by this accuſation, keepeth him ſtill captive in his chaines (for he hath not as yet forſaken him) then Chriſt, dwelling in him alſo, hath not, as yet, ſet him thus at liberty from the Devil, Hell, and Sin, that his freedom and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation might be truly found to be in Chriſt himſelf; Becauſe for him, for whom Chriſt dyed, in him alſo, he ought
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:137210:161"/>to riſe again, ſo as Death, Sin, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and Hell may have no juſt right over him, yea not ſo much as to touch him with the leaſt finger, becauſe that he being plainly freed from all theſe, by Chriſt dwelling in him, he is become a member of his body, againſt which can no accuſation or condemnation be brought: for even as the head is found blameleſs in innocency, ſo alſo is the whole body, with all its members.</p>
                     <p>Let every one narrowly prove himſelf, before he boaſteth himſelf to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this body; for Chriſt is not ſo vile in us, as we may think him to be, nor is the imitation of him ſo ſmall a thing, that it can be comprehended and known by our groſs natural reaſon. Becauſe as he was ſupernaturally conceived and born; ſo in like manner, did he operate, and ſpeak, yea whatever is manifeſted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, ought to be moſt exactly expreſſed in us in Spirit and Life, and in divine truth; therefore he that will glory that he underſtands, and knows, Chriſt and is a partaker of him, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooveth him in the ſame manner, with

                     <p>It behooveth us therefore to apprehend, and learn all theſe things in God, that the light may be ſeparated from the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that that notable difference and diſtinction, in this very point, be well known to us; leaſt we take one thing for another, <hi>viz.</hi> fleſh for ſpirit, Death for life, ſlavery for liberty, and for the free flowing grace of divine power.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things, becauſe a man, in his life time, is always willing to get, and keep Reconciliation, and eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are plainly known to a few, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as a man eſteems thoſe things in the place of God, and for things divine, which indeed do but hold him bound in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual impriſonment, being that, which is his own nature, and propriety, <hi>viz.</hi> the fear of eternal damnation, by means of which he abſtaineth from all external, and carnal filthineſs, and impurity; and cuts off thoſe things from himſelf: being then fully perſwaded that now he is truly
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:137210:165"/>at liberty, ſo that he will not proceed further on, and refuſeth to deny, and reſign up both the proper, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginary ſalvation of his Soul, although he ſhould experience, or feel in himſelf that the true righteouſneſs, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable before God, is that very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, that is done in ſpirit; and thence ſprings up the New-creature of God. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is neceſſary that every one ſhould firſt ſatisfie in all reſpects his own proper righteouſneſs, holineſs, and imaginary ſalvation, that in the end, he may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand the difference of both, <hi>viz.</hi> of Light, and Darkneſs, and of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs that is from man, and that which is from God: for if he be not faithful in the ſmalleſt things, how ſhall he arrive at greater? which certainly is impoſſible. Therefore it behooveth every one to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy his own conſcience, and with all moderation, and diſcretion, to obey the teſtimony of his own heart, that being raiſed up, thorough all the degrees of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and being inriched with all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, riches, and imaginary goods of his own ſpirit, he may at length be

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:137210:167"/>otherwiſe certain, that much writing did not conduce any thing to the increaſe of grace, but the movings of God only do. And therefore I had determined in my mind to forbear writing, leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I ſhould thereby diſturb the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy Soul, truſting in the divine mercy, that God himſelf would preſerve thee to become more ſtrong, and more pure, by his inward motions in thy Soul; and by purifying it, from all inherent evil affections, and the depraved root of inbred luſts, more then it is poſſible ever to be effected by letters written: For this is the work of God alone, and is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual in them, who ſtudy, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to ſubmit themſelves unto his will. For it is impoſſible that they who are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, and never ſtrive to quiet the accuſations of their conſciences, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, can be ſo accepted of God, as to attain to the grace of Chriſt Jeſus, to dwell in them; for he that is not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the leaſt matters, can never be made Ruler over greater things: if therefore any one is not faithful to his own Soul, with which yet, he is one, and firmly
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:137210:167"/>united, how can he love God, from whom, as yet, he is far away removed?</p>
                     <p>In this manner it is neceſſary, that every one ſhould ſtrive, with all his might, and power, for the teſtimony of his own conſcience, to renounce, his own proper Soul, as far as it is poſſible for him, in the ſight of God, according to the higheſt degree of his knowledge: now if any one ſhall do thus, in that higheſt degree, with the greateſt diligence, the Lord will in part enlighten the darkneſs of his underſtanding, as to perceive more profoundly, in himſelf, what is the true power of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> what ſort it is of, in him, <hi>viz.</hi> ſpiritual; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is concerned about an external abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from evil concupiſcences, but much more rather, about the moſt deeply faſtened root of ſin in us, in which we all were conceived out from <hi>Adam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For ſo long as the Root remaineth in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d of likeneſs thereof: And therefore
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:137210:168"/>the Godlineſs promiſed unto us, doth not only, and properly require of us, that we ſhould deſiſt from external vices, but that the very inwards of our hearts ſhould be purified, ſo as that a man ſhould be cleanſed, and perfected moſt exactly, in his underſtanding, appetite, and in his will, that he may no longer ſerve the Lord, and obey him, unwillingly; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as at firſt, a moſt troubleſome task is to be undergone, in turning away his heart from temporal, and ſpiritual captivity: but when he is united to Chriſt he muſt perfectly be freed from all the earthly concerns of his luſts. For ſeeing that, in man, there is nothing nearer to God, then the Spirit, or mind of man, therefore it behooveth, in the firſt place, to cleanſe that, from the darkneſs, and groſſneſs of reaſon, in which we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, by the fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo that we may be lead into a fuller, and more pure degree of divine knowledge, unto which no man, yet abiding in his corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can ever come.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore whoever deſires to attain the true knowledge of God, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:137210:168"/>it behooveth him, before all things, to ſtrive with all his might, to with-hold himſelf from every vice, that is become familiar to him, and to which he inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and which, ſometimes, he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth even in this very work. For man, even while yet he is in his corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in which he was conceived, is not ſo far removed from the preſence of God, but that yet he ſtill retains, in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme part of himſelf, an occult and a moſt inward ſpark of ſome knowledge of God; as it is notoriouſly ſeen, that all men poſſeſs ſome kind of power in knowledge, by help of which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern good from evil, inſomuch as whilſt they remain in the ſtate of evil, they are accuſed in themſelves, by that ſame know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, but when once they are introduced to the ſtate of good, then they are at reſt.

Moreover, becauſe man is wont to fall ſo back again into himſelf, as that he doeth that which is good, rather from the force of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, backed with ſome threatnings of the judgments of God, then from Love, and an earneſt deſire of the good, then he ſearcheth out means, by which he may be freed from that accuſation of conſcience. Now when he can find no means thus to bind down the appetites, thoughts, and motions of his fleſh, but they always ſtill get looſe again, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is that he apprehendeth that tho all outward vices, and tranſgreſſions were laid aſide, yet there ſtill remains in the fleſh the root of them, and that he cannot be freed by all his endeavours, grievings, and mournings, from that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of the fleſh, (which ſtirreth up in him Anger, Wrath, impure luſts, and vain thoughts, and ſuch like) but ſome time, or other, it will again ſeiſe upon his
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:137210:170"/>Soul: and thus he comes to ſee, that he is not ſo ſet free from the dominion of the Law, but that he always muſt yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that accuſation concerning the root of ſin, yet lurking in the moſt inward parts of his heart.</p>
                     <p>Now although the more vulgar, and common, external knowledge of Chriſt, is willing to palliate, and cover over this inward ſtain, by the bleſſed death of Chriſt, ſaying, theſe things cannot hurt a Chriſtian, Chriſt dyed for them; nor indeed ſhall I contradict them: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs becauſe Chriſt therefore came, and appeared, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil, and that he might free the captive Soul, from the burthen of its ſins, it is indeed neceſſary, that the ſame Chriſt ſhould deſtroy the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo of this ſatanical building, and by his own ſeed again ſown therein, ſhould thereby get the poſſeſſion of the heart, and mind, as it ought to be done, and as it is agreeable to the Lord alone: Even as theſe things were figured out by the type of the promiſed Land, which was promiſed to the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:137210:171"/>on this account, that every evil ſeed might be eradicated from thence. But before things could be brought to that paſs, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> muſt ſuffer many miſchie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In like manner alſo, no impure thing is taken up by Chriſt conforming in us the promiſed likeneſs of his moſt holy huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but all theſe muſt firſt be laid aſide by the death of ſin, that we being thus purified by him, ſhould be fitted unto his body, together with the moſt perfect, and common conjunction of Chriſt, as of the head of this body, from which all the members derive their motion; but the rebellious members abide not in any living body, unleſs perhaps, by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper name, they have the name of Members, for ſuch do as it were cut themſelves off from the body, and ſet themſelves againſt it, which caſe can

The Lord grant unto us all his mercy, that laying down our load of ſin, we may, by virtue of him, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored in Chriſt, who mightily aſſiſteth the hearts which are prepared, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto him, and helps to repreſs, and ſtifle the growing ſtains of ſin, and afterwards, takes in hand the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation it ſelf of our hearts, where the root of evil abideth, whence all the ſpringing fruits do proceed, even fully to burn it up by the flame of divine righteouſneſs. If God ſhall pleaſe to grant it, and neceſſity ſhall require it, I am altogether ready, according to my ſimple capacity, for the ſake of thy holy advantage, to expreſs theſe things more clearly in writing, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:137210:174"/>whom God begins to afflict with grief, and temptations. For this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the laying bare of many depravities, with which our hearts are filled; which if the Lord is pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move out of our hearts, then he thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth our whole man with Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo as we could rather chooſe to retain and keep them.</p>
                     <p>But it is more for our advantage, that thoſe depravities which poſſeſs our minds, by reaſon of whoſe preſence, a certain falſe and imaginary peace did deceive us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould therefore ſeaſonably be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from us, before that we have run out (together with them) perhaps, our whole life; being perſwaded that we ſhall gain ſomewhat, when yet we, being thus deceived, ſhall, in the end, be overwhelmed in our Souls, by an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible deluge of grief.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in this caſe lay aſide all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency of mind, for in Melancholy or trouble of mind thou pleaſeſt the Lord more truly, and art nearer unto him, then if thou ſhouldeſt perſiſt in a great tranquillity of mind, as that which is the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:137210:174"/>effect of a falſe ſecurity and peace: even as it is wont commonly to happen to thoſe, who do promiſe too much to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe that they do abſtain from the falſe religion, and from the more groſs acts of unruely ſinners, and from all unrighteouſneſs, or injuſtice; from which indeed we ought wholly, and always to abſtain, but then if any one ſhall, for this reaſon, think himſelf cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to be made a Son of God, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conſcience will oppoſe ſuch a one by its teſtimony, and will convince him, that the very bottom, and foundation of his heart does yet abound in the root of ſin, and of ſelf-love, together with all thoſe deſires, and luſts, of which <hi>Paul</hi> does teſtify, that concupiſcence is, <hi>viz.</hi> properly that ſin, which leadeth away a man into captivity.</p>
                     <p>Therefore becauſe commonly, he is accounted a pious man, who ſtudieth to be of a good outward converſation (for more then what is without, a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee) hence it is, that a man ſticks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways about theſe things, ſuppoſing that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yet for all this the root of ſin ſtill remains deeply faſtened in him: but the mind takes no further care, how it may come to the true purging out of all theſe, ſeeing it may ſeem impoſſible for a man to be freed from them. Which indeed is very true as to us, but to God all thing are poſſible: hence it is found in the elect, that God even quite conquereth ſin in man, and will rule and govern in the man, not only by plucking out all the external acts of the more groſs ſins, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:137210:176"/>to renounce them quite, inasmuch as they are ſuch, as will elſe ſtill be the cauſe of many afflictions: Let him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do this, <hi>viz.</hi> let him learn to ſubject his whole ſelf to the will of God, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf to all that God ſhall impoſe upon him, in this his tribulation, with a firm reſolution of mind, to bear them all, ſo long as it ſhall pleaſe God.</p>

                     <p>MOſt dear Lady, having this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offered, I was willing to write a few lines unto thee, giving thanks to you all, for your friendly inclinations of heart towards us: The eternal God grant, that that bond, in which we being bound, together in him, and do profeſs a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all union to the true members, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more firm, and may grow in Chriſt our Lord, according to his holy will, to his glory and our death. As to what concerns my condition, it is indeed, at preſent, ſuch as is tolerable to the fleſh, as long as it ſhall pleaſe God, for the bond of death remains in my heart, and in my members, and all the reſt is known unto the Lord. The Lord himſelf take us all
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:137210:180"/>into his protection, that we may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in his fear, this dangerous time, which, as I conjecture, cannot be done, but by moſt hard ſorrows.</p>
                     <p>O would to God, we could, at length, come even unto the death of Chriſt, and feel it in our ſouls, which indeed is ſet before our eyes in the holy Scriptures, yet ſomewhat ſhadowed. O Lord, grant unto us that life, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture every where beareth witneſs of, yet oftentimes, by ſo frequent exerciſes of ſo many various readings, a man is but kept back, and diſtracted, when, as yet, it's in the firſt place neceſſary, that every one ſhould obſerve himſelf in the acts of hearing, ſpeaking, thinking, working, and in all elſe, where a man is buſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any other matters in things of thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="341" facs="tcp:137210:180"/>Soul. Becauſe as long as any one does not ſatisfy his own conſcience, he is will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly kept a priſoner under ſin. But the difficulty of this way hindereth many, as much as that which the Scripture ſaith, that no man can ſtand before God in his own proper righteouſneſs; which is very true. However yet, if we are willing to trace thorough this moſt rocky way of our conſcience, even to its utmoſt limit, it is neceſſary, that, at length, we ſhould come to a mortification, and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all our laborious endeavours, and then will our own righteouſneſs ſhame us: On the contrary we all would dye, before ever we have lived, and glory that we have renounced our own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, when as even yet we ſtick in the midſt of our ſins, breaking forth into outward acts. But the matter is to be otherwiſe, and more accurately conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if we deſire to make a proficiency in the Lord: for that life which we live in the fleſh, is dead, in the ſight of God, nor hath no livelineſs in it, in his account. Yea furthermore, that life, which our Soul enjoys, whilſt it confideth in, and
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:137210:181"/>s bottomed on theſe or theſe things, muſt alſo be changed for a death, and it's by no means to be permitted, that the enormities thereof ſhould rejoyce in its progreſs. For this life, which our Soul hath taken to herſelf, after this manner, ſprings from no where elſe, then from out of that imaginary righteouſneſs, and holineſs which we fancy is to be found in us, and which tickles us with a ſtrange kind of ſweet flattery, and privately is very pleaſing to us, yea and gives to our Souls, a kind of tranquillity. Theſe things are hid ſo deeply in a man, and deceive us with ſuch diſſimulation, as if all were well with us; whence it is, that all things are aſcribed unto Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the man knows, that no ſuch thing can be attained to, but by Chriſt. Theſe are thoſe things, whereof the Scripture maketh ſo often mention, <hi>viz.</hi> our own proper righteouſneſs, our own proper works, our own proper holineſs, and all ſuch like, <hi>viz.</hi> if we truſt too much to any of theſe means, which were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us from the Lord, and ſtick ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto them, then to the only lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:137210:181"/>God. For to love God, is no other thing, then moſt accurately to do that which he willeth, not for the hope of any ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or of any good things whatever; for the Love of God it ſelf thus puts a man on, that he cannot do otherwiſe. And here it is, that we are able to ſearch into the moſt inward corners of our hearts, whether or no we ſeek ourſelves elſe where either in Soul or body, and whether we ſerve God, and love him for this end, that our ſouls may gain ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>But here, for the moſt part, it will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; that whatever things are done, are done, only for love: yet nevertheleſs men do perform theſe things out of the terrour, and the impulſe of their own conſcience, as the ſcripture witneſſeth. I ſay not all this, becauſe I would detract in the leaſt from good works, &amp; ſet light by them, but rather that we ſhould go on further, &amp; not to reſt here: nor am I willing we ſhould ſit down, in a private kind of peace, of having gained ſome ſteps only, before we be come unto the end, nor till the ſcope, for whoſe ſake all this is done, be duly attained. And though there be others behind us; who follow up after us,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:137210:182"/>being yet a great way off; yet it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on us, becauſe of our greater know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge received, to put out this our talent to the higheſt intereſt, we can poſſibly, that in us may be found conſtant perſeverance, if ſo be, at length, we can arrive, perhaps, to a true dying, having no need more to reiterate ſo often our renewing of death, ſo that all may together, and at once, remain buried alſo in Chriſt's death eternally; a more certain eſſential ſort of death, (as I may ſo ſay) following us into that better ſtate or condition.</p>
                     <p>Moſt beloved Lady, receive I pray thee, theſe my letters kindly, if perhaps they may prove to be of any uſe to thee in thy holy endeavors, and that we may, come at length, to the total renouncing our fleſh, that then we may be judged according to the rule of righteouſneſs, which the Law requires by Chriſt. For in Chriſt, ſin is utterly condemned to death, and as much as we are planted together with him in the likeneſs of his death ſo much alſo ſhall we, thorough his reſurrection, be received into the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or the Spirit, who then performs in
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:137210:182"/>Man the office of a Governour, and is to him in the ſtead of his life, whoſe place, before this, our fleſh ſupplied: all that is beyond this, the Lord himſelf will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to us, when we come thither.</p>
                     <p>If therefore we have our inward ſenſes rightly exerciſed by the Lord, and do firmly adhere to him with continued pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, then will he kindle in thy heart ſome living light, which my dead writings can never effect, by means of which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inflamed with a greater zeal, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all fleſh, we ſhall be able to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the Lord our hearts emptied, and ſet free by a meer, and pure ſubmiſſion unto, and a firm purpoſe of remaining, and perſevering in his will: ſo will the thing proſper, and our work will more happily ſucceed. But why this work will ſucceed with ſo much difficulty, and with ſuch a length of time, this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe ſomewhat ſtill will ſtick cloſe to the heart, which we cannot wholly renounce: for when but one half of the heart is yielded up, the offering remains impure, nor is it accepted: whence it is that the Scripture commands us to have a
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:137210:183"/>great care of or to watch ſuch a heart, which ſeeks double ways, and carrieth upon either ſhoulder, and halts on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leg, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For we cannot at the ſame time ſatisfy the fleſh (conſcience hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us) and conſcience too, (the fleſh hindering us) therefore it is neceſſary, that we yield our ſelves up wholly, as a pure offering, and grateful to the Lord, for ſuch a one is received by the Lord, and bleſſed of him, that thenceforth he may bring forth fruit, and at length, that thence may ariſe the righteouſneſs that is available before God. Unto which may the Lord promote us, and keep us by his infinite mercy in Chriſt our Lord and Saviour. The Lord preſerve us, that we may perſevere in his grace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenour of his moſt holy Will.</p>

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:137210:186"/>our ſelves, the cauſe of our holding back, and of our barrenneſs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that we are hindred, and over-ruled by things external, the contrary of which, if things proceeded aright, and we were ſound at the bottom of our hearts, would come to paſs, ſo as that which is internal, would contain, and rule in a due order, all externals; nor would it be hindred by any thing external: and thus all would prove well for our uſe and advantage in the Lord. But the Lord will much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inform us in theſe matters, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually cauſe, that if any temporal things that are leſs neceſſary, become a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den unto us, that we ſhall lay them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, ſo far forth as it is allowed to us, by our Conſcience, in the Lord, yet not without a moſt exact conſideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                     <p>For he who thus knoweth himſelf to be weak, ſo as he may eaſily be hindred by and from things external, ſtandeth altogether in need, that he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and earneſtly beg of the Lord, that he may be kept unpolluted, and that his Senſitive faculties be thus, thorough
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:137210:186"/>urgent neceſſity, always kept exerciſed with continual prayers, and an elevated heart, which would never be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neceſſity: for no prayer, doth more truely hit the mark, then that which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from neceſſity: for by how much the more preſſing the neceſſity is, by ſo much the more piercing are prayers made. So that in theſe very evils themſelves a remedy is found which leadeth us unto God; if ſo be our ultimate end be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but God; and as to things out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we propoſe to our ſelves to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to nothing but the divine will, and to perform it moſt exactly. But this caſe doth wind in a man, into ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, before it can be brought to paſs, that it will concern him to ingage his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt reſolution, and powers to ſtrive, with divers and moſt difficult pangs, and deſperate temptations, which increaſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him dayly more and more. For juſt ſo it is with theſe combatants, as with the poor wild creature, which is driven up and down by the hunters, till the time of the Lord be come: Now the Lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth us when we know it not, yea
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:137210:187"/>when we ſink into ſwoons, and are ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by ſtraights: and then doth our death truely begin when all our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance is quite blunted, and ſuppreſt. By reaſon of the weakneſs of my hand I could write no more, recommending you herewith unto the Lord, who can promote us all in his own way, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us in a conſtant diligence, and in a perſeverance of divine graces.</p>

                     <p>MY moſt beloved Siſter, That all may be well with thee in the fear of the Lord I deſire with all my heart: and thy further growth in him, does very greatly rejoyce me. For although in theſe dangerous times, many new things are here and there produced from multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied diſcords, one ſhewing this, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that way, by all which the hearts of many are diſturbed, and they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted contrary to the intention of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; Yet God hath prepared an eminent glory for them, who, with a valiant mind, do break thorough theſe things. Alſo becauſe now a narrower way is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:137210:196"/>then in times paſt, therefore alſo a greater grace is now apprehended to be in man: for by the benefit of ſtraights and anxieties are gotten all the good things, which God hath promiſed unto man, and nothing is more contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, then an imaginary peace and tranquillity, and ſuch a condition, as in which it is well with a man, and in which he liveth a quiet pleaſant life free from any vexation of adverſities, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, and other miſchiefs. Briefly, God is never farther abſent from us, then when all things happen unto us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our own wills, and when we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy every where a proſperous ſucceſs; whereas ſtraights, miſfortunes, a croſs, and a preſſing need are nearer to God, be they in matters great or ſmall, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that in theſe evils, we ſo behave our ſelves, as to bear our ſufferings with a willing mind, and with joy as from the hand of God, that thereby we gaining the knowledge of our captivity, and chains, do endeavour forthwith to put them off, and to dye.</p>
                     <p>For ſo long as we find any thing yet
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:137210:196"/>in us, which ſtirreth us up either to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or to joy, ſo long are we bound and captivated to our own ſelves, and are the Slaves of Nature: Now if we being ſet free from the firſt natural gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhould penetrate to the other that is ſpiritual, and ſhould be led into the true ſtate thereof, certainly then no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie, misfortune, injury, yea nor fire, nor ſword, nor any thing elſe that is a relict of nature can overcome a man, which ſhould be accounted by us for evil, as the Vulgar accounts them for evil; for whatſoever happeneth to a regenerate man, is accounted by him as a means to the eternal glory of God, ſo that to ſuch a man nothing is ſweet or more worthy his eſteem, then every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and injury, wherewith he is wont to be treated from others; ſo that by how much the more of them are ſent him from God, ſo much the more he will judge that he is propitious to him. But there are many things required firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can learn to acknowledge the hand of God: for when we are firſt overwhelmed by any adverſity, then
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:137210:197"/>we either throw the blame upon man or we complain that God doth afflict us: and this proceeds from this, that we yet ſtick, and lye in our ſins, becauſe of which, we are accuſed in our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and rendred Enemies to God. Therefore are all things to be laid aſide, whatſoever we acknowledge to be unjuſt, though they may ſeem never ſo ſmall, and we muſt, go forward with a ſtout, zeal, ſo that we muſt both day and night fall down upon our faces in prayers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, that he will pleaſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on us freely wiſdom and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the true knowledge of our ſelves, conſiſting not in words but in deeds, that afterwards we being our ſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, may truely dye, alſo that we may reflect upon no man in the World, but upon our ſelves, by which at laſt we may learn to acknowledge the good hand of God, who gives to his own, nought but the croſs: and this is the ſupream and ſafeſt way, by which a man is ſaved.</p>
                     <p>My deareſt Siſter, I have here in few words deſcribed to thee the Type only, or
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:137210:197"/>the picture and ſhadow of that fruit which groweth out of the croſs, yet if thou art willing to know the thing it ſelf in the truth thereof, and to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it with a right faith, thou thy ſelf wilt ſeek it properly as from thy own experience. But before thou canſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the croſs is of ſuch great advantage to thee, thou wilt feel certainly many adverſities, and miſeries, and it will behoove the to cut off many of thy accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations, that ſo thou wilt behold no body elſe but look at thy own ſelf: for it behooveth thee to find ſalvation in thy own ſelf, and ſo alſo thou art to make experiments of dying, for thy ſelf: He that is honeſt without himſelf, he alſo is ſaved without himſelf, and the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch a one ſtands allways in need, that being corroborated with the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt promiſes, it ſhould of beten renewed, becauſe it proceedeth not from God, but from man, whom it concerneth to uſe an external comfort becauſe he is deſtitute of all internal comfort. For the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God is not but in the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward receſſes of our Soul, and we then
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:137210:198"/>at laſt acknowledge and own his voice, when we are wholly freed from nature, elſe we remain always ſeprarated from him, by and thorough that Enmity which is put betwixt God and out na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As much therefore as we ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in our own nature, ſo much are we ſtill ſeparated from God, and do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his whole Eſſence, government, means, directions, gifts and diſcipline in a ſence depraved, and parverted by nature, for it holdeth us ſo captive, that as often as God ſends us certain means and helps for our [ſpiritual] death, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently this very nature by her counſel turns us off from them to others, that at laſt this chaſtning rod becomes fruſtrate, and fruitleſs, and theſe gifts of God are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for plagues, afflictions, and heavy burthens, and are received with mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, and indignation.

<pb n="380" facs="tcp:137210:200"/>but that the alone providence of the Lord is to be accepted, ſo, that there be no difference of choice in us, whether we are to wait, or whether to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and on the contrary. For this is to wait expecting on the hand of God, to ſtand ſubmitted to God, and not to live to ones ſelf, or to follow ones ſelf, or to deſire.</p>
                     <p>If we find any difference in our ſelves, ſo, as that we deſire rather this then that, then the whole thing is from our ſelves, and not from the Lord; for that which is from the Lord is free, and wholly commended to God, without any deſire of this or that thing, ſo that the divine will be done, which alſo is done, if we find our ſelves uncloathed of all deſire, how advantagious ſoever the buſineſs may ſeem in our eyes.</p>
                     <p>Yet by all this I ſhall not intangle thee, for I know, that thy mind earneſtly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth a freedom from all appetite of fulfiiling deſires. The Lord who is a true helper in all needs will be mindful of thee and of all of us, and will comfort thee with his wonderful operations and
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:137210:200"/>will lead the from the Love of the Creatures, to the Creator of all; whence all have their Original, and ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and to whom, as unto their end, all things do return in their own time: ſo that we alſo, even all of us, muſt appear in him, by our departure and death, in which notwithſtanding his eternal ſubſiſtence is manifeſted, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is to be glorified in all thoſe who, by the benefit of his death, and of the death of all thoſe which are found created in them, do arrive at that eternal communion, which by the moſt powerful hand of God, quickeneth and raiſeth up the dead, but not the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>If therefore we would enjoy the ſame reſurrection with Chriſt, we are alſo to be tranſplanted into the ſame death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yielded up to God with all our might, and becoming obedient even to death.</p>
                     <p>May the Lord inſtruct thee with a true underſtanding, that thou mayeſt meditate on his will with a piercing and continued conſideration, and may that
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:137210:201"/>be a help to thee in thy ſufferings, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his mercy, and may it direct all things for thy benefit, as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in him from eternity. Which is what I confidently believe he is about to do, and to bring all to the deſired end, by his eternal grace.</p>

                     <p>MOſt beloved <hi>N.</hi> That it is ſo long ſince I wrote to thee, this is the cauſe, that I wanted an opportunity according to my deſire, as alſo that I placed more confidence in the Lord, then in my own letters being fixed in this firm hope, that he would direct all things to the beſt end, and that he would apply a remedy to
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:137210:201"/>all diſtractions of thy heart, and that he would thruſt them all under his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: For even as I my ſelf according to my ſimple way, do confide in the Lord alone, in all my neceſſities, waiting for help from him only, ſo alſo I judge the like of thee, with firm belief, that the Lord will out of his compaſſion behold and look upon thy caſe, and will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee from all thy troubles of heart; although this thy ſtate may preſs thee to ſo much the more diligent, and fervent, and more continual calling upon God, and to a greater abode in his fear, becauſe elſe it an be no otherwiſe done, but that all labour, glory, cogitation, fruit and pleaſure of the fleſh, with all thoſe things which belong unto the world, and have communion therewith, do all, at laſt, together tend to eternal deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor can they, by any hope of life, be firmly fixed to eternity; for Death, and an eternal blotting out do paſs upon all things which are without God!</p>
                     <p>But the faithful and merciful God will have compaſſion on us, that we may be ſubjected to his chaſtiſement, with
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:137210:202"/>a continual meditation on the divine judgment, under which it behooveth all fleſh to tremble, and to give glory to God alone, that thus being yielded up unto God, we may be wholly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, and that we may ſerve him in all righteouſneſs and holineſs, as it becomes the Sons of God.</p>
                     <p>God grant this to thee, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I wiſh from the very bottom of my Soul, as the Lord alſo knows, that we may together remain given up to the Lord both in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoul.

The Lord grant that our familiarity which we have in divine love, may not, by theſe ſufferings, be diminiſhed or decreaſed, but rather be comfirmed by the divine benediction, which is fertil in all who are patient, and who in Golineſs, and the fear of the Lord, do conſtantly perſevere even to the end of the fight, although they were vexed with all manner of tryals.</p>

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:137210:203"/>thee, ſeeing I am not at leiſure to come unto thee, therefore this Epiſtle ſhall ſupply the want of my preſence. For I am wholly perſwaded in the Lord, that thy heart, yea, when not admoniſhed by me, will not yet be tyred out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in the work begun, and in the growth in the fear of God our Saviour, leaſt that any one happly ſhould diſturb &amp; confound thee by theſe or any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions; for to come at the very thing its ſelf, there is no need of many rules and exhortations.</p>
                     <p>Search narrowly into thy own ſelf, and if thou canſt find any thing for whoſe ſake, thy conſcience ſhall accuſe thee, then it concerns thee to deſiſt from that, and to dye thereunto. This therefore is requlſit, that thou learn to examine thy ſelf, whether thou ſuffereſt any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy will, and with a certain kind of indignation, nor art thou willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected with humility to all others: For its neceſſary that in all reſepects, thou ſhouldeſt account of thy ſelf from the very bottom of thy heart, for the leaſt, and the moſt deſpicable, and that thou
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:137210:203"/>willingly ſubmit thy ſelf to every body, yea to him that injureth thee. If thou wilt endeavour this, thou wilt ſoon find in thy ſelf a great defect, nor wilt thou willingly perform that, but wilt be mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to indignation, and to impatience: But if thou art never looking back, and art ſubduing the fleſh with a juſt and true zeal, and wilt accompliſh the rooting out from thy ſelf the ſerpentine nature, at length, by the breaking forth of the divine il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination, thou ſhalt find great grace in theſe things.</p>
                     <p>But here is need of great and accurate examination, and the Lord is at all times both night and day to be call'd upon with a fervent mind, that he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow wiſdom on thee to know thy ſelf, and all thy ſtains of nature, even the moſt hidden, that thou mayeſt be able to cure them diligently, to renounce them, and wholy to dye unto them. For after that the fleſh is withered, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dead, the new creature may at laſt be planted in thee, whoſe ſource is out and from God, and not out and from man, and the admonitions of man, nor out
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:137210:204"/>and from any external ceremonious rite: for it is born of God, who is a ſpirit, in our ſpirit; ſo alſo is all the true ſpiritual circumciſion of all things internal in our Soul, where it is alſo promiſed to us, that by the holy Spirit, the eternal God, the Saviour ſhall be raiſed up in us out of his own ſeed, who ſhall aboliſh all enmity, which ſtill lieth between God, and the inward man himſelf, and will eternally unite us with God, and will bring us to our Original, which is God himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Deareſt <hi>N.</hi> I ſhould indeed writ more of this to thee, for I further deſire, that thou wouldſt thy ſelf ſet too thy hand to the performance of theſe things, and that thou wouldſt get a living ſenſe in thy heart of all theſe. For in thy own ſelf thou wilt find a true monitor, who will, more rightly then I can, obſerve thy defects; neglect him not, but lend thy ear to his accuſations, and then forthwith will thereupon follow cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, very notable advances. Alſo the Lord, who heareth the deſires of all who perſevere, will not reject thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and tears, but to all whatſoever thy
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:137210:204"/>heart, preſſed down with ſtraights, and griefs, propoſed to its ſelf, he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold with merciful eyes, and ſuccour thee with a ſtrong hand. And if ſometimes he may ſeem plainly to have deſerted thee, nor that he will ever hear thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, then do thou fully believe, that at this very time he is nigheſt unto thee, that he may ſuccour thee with his help: for by how much the more miſerable, the more anxious, and the more deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any one is, ſo much the nearer is God to him, the helping of whom he then moſt ſpeedily performeth, when no comfort, nor help is found [unto or] for our deſires. And this is the true knot of all piety. The Lord grant, in his own time, that thou mayeſt truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this in thy own ſelf. For the grace, and word, and promiſes of God do abide in man in a living ſenſe, nor can it be expreſſed in words, how the very thing it ſelf properly is: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all writings may give teſtimony of this word, and of this grace, yet are not they properly that very word, and the very Salvation of God, for the virtue

The Lord knoweth, how mindful I am of thee, and how
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:137210:206"/>much care I have for thee in the midſt of my moſt ſad converſation, filled with all griefs, and in my conſtant combate. But I truſt in the eternal God, and his providence, that he will with ſtretched out arms lead and keep us all under his own diſcipline.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe I have crept thorough many dangers of mind, how great the power of corrupted nature is, is very plainly manifeſted in me, by and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the power of God; though that alſo is come to paſs by and thorough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable anxieties, in all which yet, the glory of God every where revealeth it ſelf, upon which account I am deeply concerned with a moſt vehement ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs for thoſe who are my fellow-ſufferers in theſe ſtraights, to whom the Omnipotent God will reach out his hand, and ſeaſonably ſet before their eyes the virtue of his grace, which lyeth hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe ſufferings, that at laſt the man may be ſtirred up to the deſire of the true croſs of Chriſt our Lord, in which all the treaſures of divine grace are known in their higheſt beauty, without which
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:137210:207"/>no man can be ſet free from out of the chains of his nature.</p>
                     <p>And here indeed there is need of great caution, and we muſt diligently adhere to the Lord both day and night; for often times nature cloathed with the outward ſhew of good, preſents her ſelf to us, but if ſhe be tumbled down into death, then will her fruits be at length tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made known, and the power of God will ſhine forth ſo much the more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. The Lord of his mercy be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of us all, that we may wiſely order our converſation, and the forces of all our enemies being all overcome and broken, we may at length arrive true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the true brightneſs of God. For the wall of ſeparation hindering that clarity, is great, which it behooveth with unwearied labour to diminiſh tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the benefit of the croſs, and with daily torture of mind to deſtroy.</p>
                     <p>Yet the eternal and merciful Lord pierceth thorough all darkneſs as doth the Sun, and ſo refreſheth thoſe that are in an agony, with their pains, that his grace and glory never ſhine forth more
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:137210:207"/>clearly, then from under ſufferings; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though whilſt we yet remain ſubject to vanityes, and are ſtill captives to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that claritude is ſtill very much diminiſhed; for ſo long as we yet are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied about images, the efficacy of truth (which ſeeing it is to be without any image, cannot then be united to them) is very wonderfully hindred. For God is but one only, and to know him from the very bottom of our hearts, is all the skill, and is ſuch as is never learned in an undiſturbed life.</p>
                     <p>Deareſt Coſin, I do open to thee as it were the interiour boſom of my mind, ſhewing, whither all my labour tendeth, and at what mark all my whole being, and all my words and thoughts do aim at with grief, and which I continually, with tears of heart, pour forth before my God, and do with hope, account the Lord will not reject me poor wretch, but chaſtiſe in his way, and will bleſs with increaſe my labour after the deceaſe of my nature. My Coſin, as to what concerns thoſe friends who have chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their dwelling, their outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:137210:208"/>is as yet tolerable, as alſo the outward converſation both of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of them alſo is full of piety, even as formerly: But if we look fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even to the utmoſt power of nature, and to the very bottom of the Soul, about theſe, the buſineſs have not ſo well ſucceded, even as neither can theſe be attributed to them all in common, nor are they wont to be given, or receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by words, and admonitions. To the Lord therefore I commit them, who in his own time, and according to his own good pleaſure will advance thoſe perſons higher. For they earneſtly liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and are delighted with my preſent diſcourſes: but how pleaſant they be to them even in their very Souls, the Lord knoweth, for I do not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that their progreſs forwards is yet ſo great: and perhaps, the Lord will yet for ſome time keep them ſo.</p>
                     <p>But for my part, I order my conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, for the moſt part, with my ſelf only, becauſe many diſcourſes and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions to others, do very much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb me: when yet all concerns, as well
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:137210:208"/>inward as outward, I freely would ſo deliver up and oblige to the Lord, that I would think, ſay, or do nothing but to the Lord alone; yet how much difficulty I ſhall every where find in all theſe, the Lord himſelf knoweth.</p>
                     <p>Yet he who is faithful, is never left deſtitute of power, as moſt miſerable I do find thorough the mercy of God, who helpeth my arm to fight.</p>
                     <p>As to our other familiar ſhe-friend, ſhe receiveth all with her whole heart, and a willing mind, whither they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the underſtanding, or the will: but becauſe of that ſollicitous care wherewith ſhe is involved in outward things not a few, as alſo becauſe of her trade, the true fruit cannot yet ſpring forth from the true root. But the Lord who is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, adminiſtreth, as I perceive, all means for the removing away by divers ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, theſe hindrances, and of bringing forth this fruit with deep pangs, ſo that I hope, at length, that the death of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will follow in the end. The Lord look in mercy upon her, as likewiſe on us all, that in his time, and according to
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:137210:209"/>his good pleaſure we may come to the true eſſence of divine clarity, and that we all being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, may ſerve him without fear in holineſs and righteouſneſs all the dayes of our life, now and for ever inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, in inacceſſible clarity, <hi>Amen.</hi> In the year 1552.</p>

And ſeeing that the Scripture alſo doth ſufficiently propoſe it, we are diligently to labour according to that Scripture, becauſe it is that which is ordained of the Lord for this end. Having therefore received of the Lord ſufficient knowledge concerning theſe things, let us be diligent in our indeavours; for little knowledge is neceſſary thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, if ſo be the heart it ſelf be but prepared, which inceſſantly, both day and night called upon the Lord, with intimate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire aſpiring to a union, ſo that no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can any more move it againſt the Lord, and turn it away from him.</p>
                     <p>May the Lord give unto his, mercy, and be a help to our miſery, in which we being yet bound in the darkneſs and chains of death, are ſtill captive. My <hi>John,</hi> I communicate my heart to thee in my letters, even as I enough know that thou alſo ſeekeſt my proſperity ſo that let us both together ſeek the Lord being perhaps not far diſtant in the Lord, one from another. Preſently after thy departure, it was decreed by
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:137210:210"/>the Senate that <hi>E.</hi> and <hi>W.</hi> do leave their dwellings, ſo that they muſt be gone from hence. The Lord beſtow on them his grace and mercy, that they learn to bear theſe things in true patience, even from their own brethren, and to accept from the Lord that croſs, for their own advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for the rejection of all other things, and that they may reſign up all to the Lord, and turn off from them, their brotherly Love. For <hi>Eſau</hi> always remained the brother of <hi>Jacob:</hi> but that <hi>Jacob</hi> received the bleſſing, was done of grace, according to the election of God, in which indeed <hi>Jacob</hi> did ſtand, but yet without boaſting, and without pride, for it behooved him always to bow himſelf before <hi>Eſau,</hi> in ſufferings, without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring. And although <hi>Eſau</hi> behaved himſelf with a very proud carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his brother, yet the bleſſing was continued to <hi>Jacob,</hi> though <hi>Eſau</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſnatch it from him again by perſecution. For <hi>Jacob</hi> lived not only in ſhew, but in truth, when he dwelt in tents: On the contrary <hi>Eſau</hi> cared on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for all outward things by labouring
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:137210:211"/>and hunting. The Lord grant, that we may ſo rightly immitate the birth of <hi>Eſau,</hi> that <hi>Jacob</hi> may at length come forth: for the birth-right was due to <hi>Eſau,</hi> but for this end only, that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould be brought forth. The Lord have mercy on us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>NB. The birth of</hi> Eſau, <hi>ſignifies the birth out of works under the Law, but the birth of</hi> Jacob <hi>ſignifies that that is of faith under grace.</hi>

<pb n="403" facs="tcp:137210:211"/>true increaſe; for they ſtand greatly in need of a prudent overſeer, till by their own experience in the future acceſs of age, they alſo do attain unto prudence. The Lord grant to them his grace, that they may well place their time as well in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as in piety, in which all conſiſteth, ſeeing that the Lord ought to be the end of all ſtudyes. To this mark therefore are they to aim, and to ſeek the glory of God, and not their own, nor are they to fall into themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Alſo I hope that my Uncle will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them to you with all advice unto obedience, and ſubjection, and I hope that they will perſevere in the fear of the Lord according to the capacity of their age: But we conſide in you, that you will not be wanting to them in the beſt counſels, eſpecially that they may lead a Godly, and ſober life, and that they may be turned away from all youthful appetites, and from ſuch errours as break forth at ſuch an age; moreover that if they commit any thing againſt the Lord according to their ſlender wit, they may in time be brought to the obſervation of
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:137210:212"/>their conſcience, by the benefit of which they being more diligently reſtrained, may always abhor to ſin. My <hi>D.</hi> that I thus write, nothing but my inclination towards my Nephews cauſeth it, for elſe I am aware, that you will educate them prudently, and in the fear of the Lord wherefore pardon the liberty I take, that I bluſh not to propoſe ſomewhat like thereto, inaſmuch as that what I do, is with an eye to that zeal wherewith we are both heated to find out the ways of the Lord, when as I apprehend us to be both alike, and to have altogether the ſame inclination of heart mutually one towards the other. The Lord help us yet more and more in love, as far as pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, ſo that we may but be found in a continual progreſſion thorough his grace, leaſt our time be found to prove empty and void of fruit before the Lord, but that we may always proceed from righteouſneſs to righteouſneſs. Even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I wiſh the ſame to my Nephews, that forthwith, at the very beginning, ſome agreable diſtinction of Religion may be inſtilled into them, that they may learn
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:137210:212"/>to diſcern all things with judgment, and not eaſily to take up their reſt in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means, one only excepted, <hi>viz.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt as expreſſed in his true obedience &amp; finiſhed in his Soul even unto the death of the croſs. He is ſet before us for an example, as our only ſcope, by the benefit of which we may in true illumination come to the eternal mercy of God. It will be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very profitable for them to be led as it were by the hand unto this ſcope, and that they may learn radically to ſatisfy their own conſciences, exerciſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in them, from their tender years, and to have no confidence in any other meanes ſet or contributed out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And although they ſhould find ſome virtue in themſelves, ſuch as it wont to be found in the ſerious ſtudyes of ſome of the heathen, ſuch as are Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Long-ſuffering, meekneſs, rigour and ſeverity of diſcipline, or any other, that may be introduced into our minds by ſedulity, and natural diſcretion; yet are not all theſe that very thing, which is propoſed to us in the image of Jeſus Chriſt: For their aim was no other then to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:137210:213"/>and govern their bodyes under the diſcipline of honeſty, and to keep them in due order by the moderation of Nature: but in Chriſt a certain kind of life is produced, which conſiſts not in nature, but above nature, and unto which the Wiſe Gentiles could never arrive, becauſe they were led only by the light of nature, in which God doth only ſo far operate, and manifeſt himſelf, as far as he can be know out of himſelf from his creatures, which alſo hath its defects and limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and may be changed: which things are ſuch as are not in God, becauſe he remains eternally, and abides glorified in his own ſubſiſtence and eſſence for ever and ever.</p>
                     <p>Now how much they have written concerning the knowledge of God which is in Man, and which they have in diverſe places attributed to the mind, that ariſeth not from elſewhere, then from the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious principles of the purer wiſdom, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far forth as they were able to comprehend of it in their more elevated reaſon: But they had no light and virtue of a certain real and eſſential immutation, as it were in its own ſelf, as being that which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:137210:213"/>it ſelf far beyond ſcience, and that by this way, our moſt high God expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and giveth forth himſelf not only notionally, but alſo eſſentially in all who receive him, with a ſuperabundance of thoſe graces, which in his Son he pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth upon us; ſo that our labour, diligence, and ſtudys are plainly uſeleſs to this matter, but the grace of God alone produceth this ſupernatural life, and new creature in man; the natural man, all this while, together with all his old age, being utterly ſilent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, yea dead. Therefore no active power, nor any life can remain extant in us; for if any ſuch thing ſheweth forth it ſelf in us, then in truth, we are not dead to our ſelves, but we yet live in our own proper work, neglecting the promiſe and grace which hath appeared in Chriſt. I do not therefore ſay thus, becauſe I can contemn and reject that ſame honeſt and tried life of the Heathen: for I wiſh that we all could ſubject our life to ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and that we could by far outſtrip them! There are not therefore to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their praiſe, but rather we

                     <p>The Lord correct us in his mercy, and help us all ſeriouſly to endeavour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on the beſt ways, even as alſo I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray in the behalf of thoſe my Nephews that they being lead thorough their whole youthful age, in the wayes of the Lord, may ſubject themſelves to diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and apply the bridle to their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inclinations, even from their tender youth, ſatisfying their conſciences, and the teſtimony of a moſt cloſe examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made before God and their own Souls; that they may be further advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lord, if it ſhall ſo pleaſe him, to that eminent grace, and expreſſion of his moſt high glory in the life of the ſpirit, which being in a flouriſhing condition, all things paſt do vaniſh away together with their glory, that all may be renewed by the firſt fruits of Chriſt, and the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

But high pride of heart, and a contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſteem of our Neighbour, as alſo the doing him injury, never is allowed a place in the Chriſtian State, but rather that which hath a fair ſhew of ſome ſort of Zeal that is natural, mixed with Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal rigour. For nothing hath appeared in Chriſt, but meer ſufferings and death, ſilence and patience even to the Croſs, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which even to the laſt gaſp of his life he ſignalized his obedience, in which he was ſubjected to his Father withour mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring;

But before we can come to the purity of theſe motions, as it manifeſted it ſelf in Chriſt, againſt them who diſhonoured God and profaned his Temple, certainly there are many things to be eradicated out of our fleſhly part, if we would be thought to be wholly burning in zeal of ſpirit.

                     <p>But then if any one proceed further, and draweth forth all his ſtrength even unto the top of all his age, then comes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, that we are unwillingly lead into the will of God, by a manifeſt other proceſs; and then thoſe judgments ſeem to hang over us, which once we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to others, and that youthful life free and wanton, ſwelling with zeal, is now by the juſt judment of God, under the decreaſings of old age, condemned to death; but then at length ſucceeds under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and diſcretion, together with continual ſufferings in the ways of the Lord even unto our death, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſentence pronounced to us: for juſt as all that ought to dye, that is poſſeſſed of
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:137210:217"/>life, alſo is that matter here. For God alone, if he be truly in us, is conjoyned with death, but not with our life; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no fleſh, how pure ſo ever it be, can abide in his ſight.

But on the contrary <hi>Calvin</hi> failed in that point wherein he rejected all the powers of man univerſally, which indeed I allow to be true, unleſs that I alſo judge that that knowledge which lieth hid in man, and convinceth him, doth yet partake of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and humane power, although the Lord doth afterwards offer to the heart
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:137210:218"/>the light of the Goſpel, and the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of a man ſubmitteth it ſelf to that: But for all that he is not yet one with the light, for no man receiveth this light, but he in whom the reaſon and ſtrength of man are on the Croſs become dead with Chriſt; now ſuch a one thence-forward, becauſe of the communion he hath received with the death of Chriſt, is alſo again raiſed up by the ſame Spirit of Chriſt, ſo as the Spirit of Chriſt thence-forward becometh his life, his own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and all his own powers abiding in death, nor is there a Soul living in him, but by the vertue of God: and thus the man comes to renounce all his own ſtrength, and all his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the ſight of God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes conformed to the righteouſneſs of God in himſelf, which the natural man never knoweth, nor can arrive thereat. Therefore becauſe the Judgment of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> reaches not ſo far, and he himſelf is not yet dead to his own reaſon &amp; ſtrength, he indeed bore witneſs againſt his own ſelf, becauſe that which in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> is demonſtrated to be death, by
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:137210:218"/>the Goſpel (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10, 11. and 6.5, 6.) keeps him in life; the light of the Goſpel ſerving him for that purpoſe, even to his own proper commodity. For the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was not divulged till after the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt. And then at length Chriſt the Son of God was acknowledged to be in us, otherwiſe our acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not concerned, but only about the perſon of Chriſt according to the fleſh, from whence it is apparent, that we our ſelves are ſtill carnal, and though we be not plainly like to the ruder part of the World, and do account our ſelves for imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators of Chriſt who have left all, yet ſtill we are to be made liker unto Chriſt, and to be planted into his death. Furthermore, I here further acknowledge, that no man by the ſtrength of Nature, derived from <hi>Adam,</hi> can ever attain unto the eternal mercy of God. That ſtudy indeed, and that labour by which ſuch a man in his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous endeavours is tired our, before he can arrive at the grace of Chriſt, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge for humane, and that it is ſubject to the Law; but that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which one acquireth by this ſtudy,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:137210:219"/>is not as yet that righteouſneſs which is prevalent in Gods ſight, for this is, at laſt, after the Law, conſtituted in us by Chriſt. Firſt therefore a man muſt labour under the rigour of the Law, even to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perfection of himſelf, and to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt innocency he poſſibly can; yet when all this is done, the Soul is to feel, at length, the judgment of God, and ſeeing it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly abide therein, it falls mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly down into death, and then at length, is it by Chriſt raiſed again into the life of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>But now the acknowledgment of the righteouſneſs of God, in common, is by the Church, which is nearer to us, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in ſuch a manner as this; That God thorough and by Chriſt crecteth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation meerly without any addition of works: which I grant: But becauſe theſe, under the law, obtained no righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the benefit of Works, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put no ſtudy or rigour, therefore they alſo cannot for Chriſt; ſake renounce, nor forſake their goods, ſeeing as yet they had gained none. For they would have them renounce, what they have not,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:137210:219"/>but in the interim, they ſuffer loſs alſo in that which they have not yet arrived at. That therefore which they ſay, is true, but it is not rightly apply'd by them, as all the Scripture doth demonſtrate, that it is by their own faults, that they come not to the truth. Nevertheleſs I am unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to deny unto them all grace for their portion and according to the meaſure of their gifts (ſeeing that they ſtudy with all their might for Chriſt, and by the help of the Scripture do hear ſomewhat of him) provided they be faithful in what they acknowledge, and that to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.

                     <p>DEareſt <hi>John,</hi> that acknowledgment of <hi>Diederick Phillips</hi> concerning
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:137210:220"/>the New Creature, I do partly own for truth, if it be not ſtretched further then it reacheth, <hi>viz.</hi> that it can, according to the teſtimony of Scripture, lead to Repentance, and to lead a pious life. But if that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and life ſo corrected thereby, he would have to be put for the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whilſt yet the Conſcience is ſtill under the burden of ſins, then is it erron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous; for whilſt that no death hath as yet happened, and ſtill ſin lieth ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the whole man, that by means of an accuſation it often driveth the ſoul into ſadneſs, the Soul is yet under the Law, for by the Law in our conſciences we are convinced of ſin. And though a man may force into ſilence that accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that burden of ſin that torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our conſcience, and that by Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſes, and ſo comfort himſelf, yet it muſt be confeſſed, that then he ſtill abides in the ſtate of the old Man, and is not yet arrived at the death of it. For the New Creature is not ſubject to ſin, therefore alſo no accuſation of the Law in the Conſcience can touch it, for then a man liveth wholly under grace, and his
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:137210:220"/>mind ſtands in no need to be ſuſtained by the external comforts of the Scriptures, or alſo by the abſolution from ſins, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the teſtimony of Scripture, it ſhould bring forth to him a greater confidence; for his life is in the Spirit, and conſiſteth under the Law of the grace of God: wherefore alſo the conſcience in its puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enjoyeth the higheſt peace, remaining ſealed by the Holy-Ghoſt: but in them who are ſtill under conſcience, the Law of ſin ſtill exerciſeth its power, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth ſtill accuſe perpetually for ſome ſins, ſo that it hence appears openly, that ſuch are not yet dead to the Law, becauſe the accuſation of the Law doth ſtill remain in its power, ſo long as by the tranſgreſſion of the Law ſomewhat is committed againſt conſcience: and though we will not confeſs, that we are under the Law, or under the accuſation thereof (notwithſtanding, that there can be no accuſation, but by virtue of the Law ſtill reigning here or there) yet is the thing manifeſt by conſcience its ſelf, which thorough an accuſation for ſin, rendreth us guilty. If therefore we could
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:137210:221"/>ſtand in purity by the blood of Chriſt, according to the inward man, then indeed the Law by its virtue, which it hath in the Conſcience thorough ſin, durſt not ſo aſſault the Soul of a man, as that he muſt ſeek comfort out of the Scriptures, and to be reconciled with God, and to be confirmed by a new promiſe of grace; becauſe grace in the regenerated hath taken moſt deep root according to its own true nature, ſo that ſuch have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no need to ſeek out ſome remedy out of their own ſelves. Which whilſt others do, they do in this very point teſtify that they have not attained to that of which they boaſted, and which they, by the teſtimonies, of the Scriptures, attributed to themſelves, in the very truth, and according to the proper eſſence of the thing. For the old man, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways by force uſurpeth the empire in man with tranſgreſſion (which indeed is termed a tripping, and is made light of, yet nevertheleſs in the ſight of God, it can never be tollerated in the new man, without real mortification) alledgeth a contrary teſtimony, <hi>viz.</hi> that we yet live
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:137210:221"/>the life of the old man, nor as yet are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed unto death, becauſe that no ſin can be committed againſt our wills, and without pleaſure or delight. Hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it manifeſt, that we ſtill are kept in the life of the old man, and are not yet arrived at the new life: for a man comes not to the death of natural ſtrength, in his carnal life, and with the complacency of proper will, or by the ſtudy of proper righteouſneſs and auſterity, but againſt its own will, <hi>viz.</hi> it is to be ſubjected on the croſs, to the obedience of God, by the means of pouring forth of the blood of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord; into whoſe communion we are taken by a like death, according to the inward man, ſo that on the croſs we wholly put off our natural life which we had in the fleſh, being bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with Chriſt, and afterwards raiſed up again into another ſupernatural life: ſo as the power of the Law, which being as yet not perfectly killed, lurketh in the members of our natural body, is wholly enervated in the mind and Soul, and in the whole humanity, having utterly loſt all right in and upon the life of man: For
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:137210:222"/>a man is not excited into ſuch a life, ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>MY <hi>John,</hi> I received thy letters toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the books, and having ſomewhat peruſed them, I gain'd the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the greater part of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, yet I ſhall keep the Books till thou comeſt. But the opinion of the Writer is contrary to my mind, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the knowledge only of a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divine truth, and not in an eſſentia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> truth of God. And this is my opinion ſeeing no man can be more inſtructed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this way, than the Writer
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:137210:222"/>himſelf of theſe Books. If I may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his fundamentals from his Books, it cannot poſſibly be, that any of thoſe who are inferiour to him, can more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily explain the thing to me. Yet I am willing, that thou ſhouldeſt enquire how they carry themſelves in their converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; that thou wouldeſt as exactly &amp; as poſſibly thou canſt, find out alſo the reſt of their ſtate or condition, for when thou ſhalt come hither, I ſhall more fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to thee my opinion concerning thoſe Writings. Now I only ask pardon, ſeeing that matters are thus, the cauſe whereof, if it ſhall pleaſe the Lord, I ſhall tell thee, at thy coming. May the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and faithful God have mercy on them and us, that in an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their darkneſs, they may be led by the Lord in the ſtraight way unto his eſſential truth, before which the natural Reaſon which inordinately appropriateth God to it ſelf, may utterly periſh: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I fear they are ſtill too much bound, though they think themſelves clearly ſet free therefrom. For all that for which they labour and contend, and which they
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:137210:223"/>account their utmoſt aim, as far as I can imagine, muſt yet be judged of God; for that which reaſon endeavoureth to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with them by knowing, all that, muſt be God himſelf, ſo that nothing but God can acknowledge himſelf in us; we in the mean time, being by a real death of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoul, as to our creaturely part, wholly laid aſide: and then that life, which ought to be in us, can be nothing elſe but Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith likewiſe, ſo that after we are buried by death, we are no more raiſed up again into Nature, but into the Spirit; For nature remaineth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned upon the Croſs, and being once dead, is not again revived: Now I judge that nature in theſe people is ſtill egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and in very deed, and eſpecially alive; although they may think, that they are already purified, becauſe that they perſwade themſelves, through their ignorance and blindneſs, that they have already plainly conquered that combat of an accuſing conſcience. I write all this to thee with the greateſt brevity, becauſe thou didſt demand my opinion, but when (God permitting) thou ſhalt come thy ſelf,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:137210:223"/>we will talk more concerning them. My Opinion therefore (as I ſaid) is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to theſe Writings, and my mind can no waies aſſent unto them. For that aim (which the Writer himſelf calleth the Intellect of God) in my ſenſe is indeed nothing elſe, than that they would have Nature, as yet not deadned, to become a propriety to themſelves, when indeed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before it be dead cannot be otherwiſe in it ſelf: for in it the higheſt death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth. True indeed that by reading I find ſomewhat concerning Death, and of the abnegation of the reaſon, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of Nature, ſo as that the Author would have all humane wiſdom and knowledge overturned, before we can come to the truth of God: yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the Soul of a Man doth remain proper to him, yea though he renounce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his intellect, ſo that in this very point the Writer erreth, in which he tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth others, and in truth far more vilely, ſeeing that he thereby would come to a greater knowledge, but eſpecially that he, by the means of his temerity, would arrive at that, which others ſeek by
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:137210:224"/>means of worſhip and ceremonies. For theſe, from a vow, do love their body, goods, wife and children, that they may poſſeſs the inheritance of heaven: but they do forſake their natural and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome and reaſon, that they may obtain ſomething that is better, <hi>viz.</hi> the underſtanding of God, and yet both of them are ſtill captivated in that, that their Ipſeity or Ineſs ſtill remaineth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to them, although to ſome more miſerably then to others. Now it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that they ſhould, this way, arrive at the truth of God, and can poſſibly be planted into liberty, as in the ſight God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe that they are not lead in tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="429" facs="tcp:137210:224"/>that they themſelves might by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of that thing conſerve life which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ought to be the condemning ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and the death of their ipſeity. For if the Truth of God ſhould enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in &amp; by a certain eſſential ſtate, it would be impoſſible, that a man could endure one ſpark thereof, without being melted quite down. Therefore we muſt dye, not only as to our wiſdom in the higheſt degree, but as to our own proper Salvation, that God alone may be our Wiſdom, life, and Salvation. This done our ipſeity is condemned before God, and thruſt down into a death (according to the fleſh) which is as it were eſſential, whence nothing can again bud forth, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of God, or of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo that whatſoever had bin ours, ought to be altogether made ſubject to its death, judgment, and ſentence of condemnation. That ſame ſmall laſt Chapter is contrary to that writing, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it determineth, that ſometime calm ſeaſons may be gained, even accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fleſh (for ſo I transfer it, even as the writing its ſelf ſpeaketh) ſo as they
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:137210:225"/>then may eſteem themſelves pure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they who are purified, know how to apply all things to a true uſe. Which I alſo affirm, but in its own meaning, but that at which this writing aimeth, is contrary to my mind: for the liberty of Chriſt belongs to the inward man, and doth only affect the mind unto eternal ſalvation in Divine Truth, but the fleſh is condemned, and ſuppreſſed and bound down into death, ſo as that no man can then rightly uſe the Creatures of God, but with grief and miſery, becauſe that in all theſe a man may behold his own death, in which formerly he had thought to have found life; and yet with theſe very things he is well contented, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging this divine judgment for truth, and ſo remains yielded up into death. But the Inward man is then converſant in eternal joy, being ſigned or ſealed by the Spirit of God.</p>
                     <p>I have wrote this in haſte, that I might ſatisfie thy deſire, according to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of my mind. The Lord have mercy on them, on us all, and pluck us quickly out of our errors. Alas! who

For the natural life, faculty, underſtanding, wiſdom, and ſenſe do all tend to death in time, and though a man deluded by ſome fair ſhew, may imagine to himſelf an eternal permanency of theſe things, yet when the ſun is riſen to a burning ſtrength, all theſe will dry up, or wither; nor is it poſſible for them to conſiſt or abide the juſt judgment of God, as being that which melteth all down: yea fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore the very diſcretion it ſelf of the ſoul muſt dye likewiſe, as far as the natural man ſtudyeth to preſerve it, if that that man, according to the teſtimony of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, is willing to ſatisfy the Law, leaſt that ſoul do tumble down into utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Now becauſe it is not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per diſpoſition of the natural man to loſe any thing, but rather with the top of the life of the Soul, to preſerve all things, therefore it is ſubjected to the divine judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that is, to death: and becauſe he
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:137210:228"/>is willing to conſerve life in himſelf, and in his Soul (now there is life no where but in God) the ſoul cannot come at the true nouriſhment of life, but is to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al up to death, inaſmuch as the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man properly is death it ſelf and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to death. For they are bound up together into one body, and both, <hi>viz.</hi> the body from the ſoul, and on the other part the ſoul from the body are moved together, whether it be to grief, or to joy, yea though it be in the ſtate of the higheſt knowledge, unto which the ſoul, according to the natural rule of life could poſſibly aſcend. For ſhe cannot be elevated higher in underſtanding, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs firſt as to her knowledge (by which the natural man is informed by her) ſhe ſhall dye, ſo, as that it behooveth both ſoul and body, as one man, to dye, after that the ſpiritual conception is; now out of that deadned ſeed, is wont to ſpring forth a new plant, enriched with divine fruitfulneſs, which no death can touch any more, neither according to ſoul, nor according to body, becauſe this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not of man, but without man, nor
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:137210:229"/>out of his will, but without his will, not with hope, but without all hope, arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at the ſtate of eternity, out of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal grace of God, ſo as that it is of God, and of life, always abiding, nor is it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, even as alſo God is in his own nature. Every thing therefore returneth to that, out of which it firſt ſprung, <hi>viz.</hi> the natural man, with its perfect body, and in its ſphere, to death without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection at all according to its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature; and the ſupernatural man in its perfect ſphere, to eternal life, abiding eternally in God, and yet as a Creature, but glorified in God. He who comes to this ſtate cannot deny the truth of the thing: but he who partaketh nothing thereof, alſo as a natural man uttereth with truth, that he believeth that there is no reſurrection, and although he ſhould confeſs it, yet even that confeſſion of the reſurrection muſt dye, becauſe unto the natural man, as ſuch, there never (even eternally) belonged any reſurrection; even as it is impoſſible for a ſeed ſown, to come to a perfect death, unleſs it be wholly corrupted in its ſelf. If therefore
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:137210:229"/>it can be brought to paſs, that a man can give up himſelf to death, with a hope of receiving forthwith another life, and as to that ſtate, and according to that rule of his knowledge, wherein he is dead, a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (for no man can, whilſt his preſent underſtanding is in being, attain to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtanding or life, unleſs the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer be firſt dead) then indeed there would be no need to proceed to a further death, becauſe it can only follow that which had been in being before. Now therefore there is here place for death, when by the benefit of corruption, through the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God, a new plant ariſeth accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of the corruption done, every thing according to its own kind, as there is example in all creatures, and in the corruptible propagation of them. So that by how much the more the natural man affirmeth that there is no more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, by ſo much the more he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth it, becauſe he truly is preparing himſelf for death, and uttereth publickly his Teſtimony concerning his corruption, and his eternal death: for there is to be no Reſurrection of him: and thus alſo to
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:137210:230"/>his, may (together with the Keepers whom the Phariſees ſet) a Teſtimony, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reſurrection of Chriſt, be given, which alſo by this means is mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed for them, who ſtand in the very door to ſuch a ſtate, and do believe it. For when the Phariſees having ſealed up the Sepulcher, had concluded, that they had ſhut up a kind of dead Corpſe, and to have kept it in that pit of Death, the keepers of the Sepulcher, who yet were ſent to do miſchief, became witneſſes of his Reſurrection, although it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to this very day, but by his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (by the Keepers is meant the natural man.) My Brother, this my own true Epiſtle will clearly open to thee my mind, and will be to thee, as it were, the hand of a Dial which thou muſt well eye and conſider, that thou maiſt likewiſe write back thy opinion to me, whereby it may appear, wherein we agree, and wherein we differ, if we are careful concerning this opinion. The Lord look upon us all in his mercy, and bring us into his own clearneſs.</p>

                     <p>MY Brother, Let us go to that man, and let us ſet before him Death, and Life, Reſurrection, and incorruptibility, all unfolded in their own degree and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and it ſhall be at his pleaſure to make choice of any one of theſe. For if he ſhall chooſe nature in his life, then in good earneſt he muſt periſh in an eternal death, nor ſhall he ever arrive at ſuch a life as he ſeeks: but if he will approach unto the truth (even as alſo the thing is) he ſhall live while he dieth, and he ſhall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the true Reſurrection, which elſe is denied to him. My Brother, May God exhibit to him and to us his mercy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variety of his compaſſions: nor may he ever leave us in our miſeries, but remember us in this life ſubject to ſo many ſufferings, in which we cry out la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boriouſly unto the Lord with many ſighs,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:137210:231"/>that by his hand we may be promoted to incorruptibility; which can by no means be effected, but by our death, which comprehends in it ſelf the relinquiſhing of all thoſe things, which we know by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and poſſeſs, and love, and in which we live. The power of death ſhall be known to all things living, but by ſo much the more difficulty, by how much the greater knowledge ſome have on this earth: for at the time of death, all things are to be given up to God, and then all things are ſhut up, and ended in the truth of God. The Lord unite us with himſelf, who himſelf is the beginning and end; old and new; yet is he one, and immutable, void of all increaſe in himſelf, though in the temporary creature, he is known with increaſe and decreaſe.</p>
                     <p>As much therefore as we depart from temporarineſs, ſo much are we united with God, in whom there is no time, and in him who is the laſt and the firſt, with an everlaſting preſence, and in him all Multiplication and Subſtraction of time is taken away and made co-equal; and all fleſh, which is ſpiritualized, and which
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:137210:231"/>was wont to expreſs it ſelf in time, doth melt away before eternity. The Lord be merciful to us all, as of one fleſh, that bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding farewel to that ſhadow of time, we may grow in his fear, and let his name be more and more ſanctified over all his creatures in time, and let our life periſh and vaniſh away like ſmoke, even as in is evidently done to all fleſh: together with which, all things do tend to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whatever it was that ever ſprung from it, whether they were deeds, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were thoughts. But it is not ſo with him, who is godly, for he, with all his works, is preſerved, and will grow and live to Eternity, becauſe every appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, life, and deſire of his, is nothing elſe but God, and therefore whatſoever is his, tendeth to Eternity. As on the contrary, the deſire and ſcope of a worldly man, is nothing elſe but fleſh, which alone doth alſo move and direct him: therefore the effect muſt periſh with the cauſe, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teſtifies: for the fruit cannot be otherwiſe then is the root whence it is ſprung. May our eternal Saviour Chriſt Jeſus purifie us, that in him we may bring
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:137210:232"/>forth true fruit, and according to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of that his moſt abundant Grace, which God hath richly poured forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, from the very beginning of the World, we may abide permanent in him. <hi>Amen.</hi>

<pb n="447" facs="tcp:137210:233"/>work of man, but the gift of God, yea a great, and eminent gift to endure the folly of another, and to cover it over with an unvariable mind towards his Neighbour. For though we be unduely uſed or handled by our Neighbour, yet in truth a purified heart ought not to be moved by it, but muſt alwaies act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the bond of Charity, which is alone its aim, for in that there ariſeth no ſuſpicion of evil, and although modeſt reaſon alſo may deſcend to make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, yet even all that too muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies done without any motion of mind, for as much as he is ſuch a one as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and trouble of no creature can move him, becauſe he remains confirmed in that which is truly immovable.</p>
                     <p>Deareſt Brother, I therefore write thus, that if that ſame trouble ſhould be reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, thou maiſt alwaies have this aim fixed in thy ſight. For although as to the creature the juſtice is on your part, yet the mind ought to remain alwaies free, without the uſe of this right, otherwiſe there would ariſe an enmity from thence, and a bitterneſſ of heart: For thus, that
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:137210:234"/>which is earthly, overwhelmeth that which is heavenly with ſuch a blindneſs, that it plainly ſeems to a man, that he hath ſome divine right; whenas yet God cannot but love, nor doth he require any other thing of us according to the meaſure of his Juſtice. Not as if I would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay ſome blame upon thee, do I ſay thus, but that thy heart may not be, nor that any rule ſhould be wanting to thee; if you behave your ſelf otherwiſe, thou wilt be obnoxious to a heavier judgement, except thou proceedeſt with caution. My Brother, ſtrive to have a mind unmoved, which cannot be hindred, but rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by the enmity of the Creatures. All things to a juſt man turn to good, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be death, or life, or diſſention, or love: for ſuch a one, overlooking the Creature, taketh all, as from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, whether they be grateful or ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and though we may not as yet come thus far, yet is this to be accounted for a rule, and to be followed with all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. And with this I would have thee recommended to the Lord, who will be helpful to us all, and keep and promote
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:137210:234"/>us all more and more in his own way.</p>

But the Lord will again bring forth his holy one out of death and the grave, that he may not ſee corruption. My brother, thy preſſure is great and ſevere: I know thou deſireſt comfort, but from God only, who cannot come, but thorough the death of all creatures, or of the whole created nature; until the laſt breath of life be alſo breathed out, nor can any refreſhment of members be hoped for. Let us in a
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:137210:237"/>free communion be made partakers of thy ſufferings, with divine compaſſion, patiently expecting the accompliſhment of the judgment in its own order; further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more we will labour according to the will of God, and we will ſweat till we come to the appointed end, even as the hand of the Lord ſhall over rule us. May the omnipotent Lord, by his fatherly grace lead us thorough this moſt difficult labour, and ſtrengthen us according to the inward man, that we may forſake that which is external, and deliver it up to eternal corruption, from out of the firſt judgment, to his eternal praiſe and glory, to which we all aſpire everyone of us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own manner and ſervice, but not for our ſakes, or for our commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, as ſome now unjuſtly do, and think: wherefore alſo this counterfit opinion ſhall ſink down into defect and death to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the death of the creature, by a moſt hard and terrible fall. Becauſe all that, that we poſſeſs with a lye, in time, muſt be yielded up to the eternal truth, but all to the glory of God, ſo that at length, one may become a look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:137210:237"/>to the other, and God at laſt may overcome all, and perſiſt alone, but we in our lies muſt periſh. My bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the times of our parents, and forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are paſſed, and labor belongeth now to our time, to the end alſo of which, all things preparatory are at hand. The Lord ſtretch out his hand with mercy, over wretched me, and over us all, that we may be taken into the order which is pleaſing to him, thorough faith, under the obedience of his eternal will, ſo that our will, life, and choice being ſubjected to his judgment, may be condemned and conſumed. May the Lord give to us all, communion in God, with a conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of eternity, according to his unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mercy. Moreover my brother, as to my ſtate or condition, that abideth in perpetual agony of death, with moſt ſharp perſecution, performed within me, after various manners, yet to one only end, for whoſe ſake all muſt be done. What the Lord may in time do with me, is known only to himſelf, and his eternal decree. But which way ſoever I turn my ſelf, and whatſoever I conſider or
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:137210:238"/>behold, nothing but a vaſt abyſs, and a parching heat of all miſery do continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſent themſelves to my eyes.

                     <p>DEareſt Brother, may the Omnipotent Lord preſerve my mortified body according to his mercy in his divine will. I have purpoſed to go to that place, and to expect the will of God concerning me, beſeeching him from the moſt inward and deepeſt bottom of my ſoul, that he will ſet me before the enemy, and that the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of my life, which is very ſmall, may not tend to the deſtruction, but to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of any one, this I beg from his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal goodneſs and mercy, withal hoping, that this danger will prove deſtruction to me only, and will go no further. The Lord make known his will to me in this one deſire of mine, according to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration. If the Lord ſhall ſuffer me in this tabernacle, tolerably to paſs through, ſo as ſtill to ſubſiſt, as I have occaſion I ſhall ſignify it to thee.
